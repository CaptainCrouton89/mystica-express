Task: Fix ImageGenerationService.test.ts
Instructions: Fix the test failures in tests/unit/services/ImageGenerationService.test.ts

The tests are failing with:
- `TypeError: this.styleRepository.findById is not a function`
- Mock setup issues for external services

Reference files:
- tests/helpers/mockSupabase.ts - Mock utilities
- tests/unit/services/ImageGenerationService.test.ts - The failing test
- src/services/ImageGenerationService.ts - The service being tested

Figure out what mocks are missing or incorrectly set up and fix them.

Give me short, information-dense updates as you finish parts of the task (1-2 sentences, max. Incomplete sentences are fine). Only give these updates if you have important information to share. Prepend updates with: [UPDATE]

I'll examine the failing test and fix the mock setup issues.[UPDATE] Found the issue - `styleRepository.findById` method doesn't exist in the mock, but the service calls it. The service expects `findById` but the mock only has `findStyleById`.I can see the main issues:

1. **Primary Issue**: `styleRepository.findById` method doesn't exist in mock - service calls `findById` but mock has `findStyleById`
2. **Mock S3Client Issue**: The mocked S3Client isn't being properly constructed - `mockSend` isn't being called correctly
3. **Missing style property**: Service expects `style_name` but mock provides `name`

Let me check the StyleRepository to understand the correct method name:Perfect! Now I can see the actual StyleRepository has `findById` method. Now let me fix the test mocks:

Task: Fix Item Service spec gaps
Instructions: **Problem**: The Item Service specification (docs/plans/service-specs/item-service-spec.md) lists many methods but several lack implementation details.

**Specific Gaps**:
1. `getItemHistory()` and `addHistoryEvent()` - no repository method names specified
2. Weapon-specific methods reference WeaponRepository that may not exist
3. Pet-specific methods reference PetRepository that may not exist
4. Missing implementation details for several "Integration Points" methods

**Your Task**:
1. Read mystica-express/src/services/ItemService.ts to see what's actually implemented
2. Check if WeaponRepository and PetRepository exist in mystica-express/src/repositories/
3. For each incomplete method specification in the spec:
   - If the method exists: add full implementation details from actual code
   - If the method doesn't exist: mark as "TODO - Not Yet Implemented" with proposed signature
   - If the repository doesn't exist: note that in the spec
4. Update docs/plans/service-specs/item-service-spec.md to be complete and accurate

**Focus Areas**:
- Section 4: Item History Audit Trail (methods 4.1 and 4.2)
- Section 5: Weapon-Specific Operations (all methods)
- Section 6: Pet-Specific Operations (all methods)
- Section 7-9: Integration Points (validate these are accurate)

Return a summary of what you found and what you fixed.

Give me short, information-dense updates as you finish parts of the task (1-2 sentences, max. Incomplete sentences are fine). Only give these updates if you have important information to share. Prepend updates with: [UPDATE]

I'll analyze the ItemService implementation and update the specification to be complete and accurate. Let me start by examining the current implementation and checking for the referenced repositories.Now let me check for the WeaponRepository and PetRepository to see if they exist:Good! Both repositories exist. Let me check their implementations:Now let me read the current item service specification to see what needs to be updated:[UPDATE] Found significant gaps in the specification - several method signatures missing and repos exist but aren't fully documented.

Now let me check if there are any item history methods implemented in the ItemRepository:Great! Let me check the ItemRepository to get the actual implementation details:Perfect! Now I have all the information I need to update the specification. Let me make the comprehensive updates:Let me check the exact format of the specification:I see the issue - the method names in the spec don't match the actual implementation. Let me make targeted updates to fix the specific gaps I identified:Now let me add the TODO markers for the missing implementations:I see additional content was added. Let me read the file again to see the current state:Let me continue updating the TODO sections individually to avoid conflicts:Let me find and update the upgrade methods correctly:Let me continue updating the implementation sections that still need updating. I'll focus on the most critical missing pieces and continue systematically:Now let me find and update the upgradeItem method:[UPDATE] Completed updating all method specifications with implementation status - found 3 methods fully implemented, 7 with TODO status, and validated repository dependencies exist.

Let me provide a summary by creating a quick report of what I found and fixed:

## Summary

I analyzed the Item Service specification and updated it to be complete and accurate based on the actual implementation. Here's what I found:

### ‚úÖ **Fully Implemented Methods**
1. **`getItemDetails(userId, itemId)`** - Complete implementation with materials and stats
2. **`getUpgradeCost(userId, itemId)`** - Full cost calculation with gold balance checks  
3. **`upgradeItem(userId, itemId)`** - Complete upgrade workflow with transactions

### üîß **Available via Repositories (Ready for Service Integration)**
4. **`addHistoryEvent(itemId, userId, eventType, eventData)`** - ItemRepository has full implementation
5. **`getItemHistory(itemId, userId)`** - ItemRepository has full implementation
6. **Weapon operations** - WeaponRepository fully implemented with combat stats, hit bands, validation
7. **Pet operations** - PetRepository fully implemented with personality, chatter, validation

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **TODO - Not Yet Implemented in ItemService**
8. **`getUserInventory()`** - Basic inventory listing
9. **`createItem()`** - Item creation for loot/starter items
10. **`getPlayerTotalStats()`** - Equipment stat aggregation  
11. **Material integration methods** - Apply/replace materials
12. **Equipment integration methods** - Equip/unequip items

### üîç **Key Findings**
- **WeaponRepository and PetRepository exist** and are fully implemented with comprehensive features
- **History audit trail is ready** - just needs service layer integration
- **Repository validation gap**: Pet operations lack ownership validation (noted in spec)
- **Parameter order corrected**: Implementation uses `(userId, itemId)` not `(itemId, userId)`

### üìã **Spec Updates Made**
- Added implementation status markers (IMPLEMENTED/TODO/AVAILABLE)
- Updated method signatures to match actual code
- Added detailed repository method calls with parameters
- Noted missing dependencies and integration points
- Corrected parameter order throughout

The specification now accurately reflects what's implemented vs. what needs work, making it a reliable development guide.

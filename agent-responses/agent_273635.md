Task: A-3 Data Seeding Validation
Instructions: Validate assumption A-3: "30 SF locations properly seeded with correct data structure"

**Context:** F-01 Geolocation & Map System backend implementation

**Assumption to validate:** The seed data contains exactly 30 locations across 5 location types (park, library, gym, coffee_shop, restaurant) with proper SF coordinates and data structure matching the schema.

**Relevant requirement:** AC-3 (30 SF locations seeded with diverse location types)

**Context hints:**
- File candidates: ["migrations/seed_sf_locations.sql"]
- Entry points: ["INSERT INTO locations statements"]
- Tech: ["PostgreSQL", "UUID generation", "Geographic coordinates"]

**Trace the data seeding:**
1. Count total number of INSERT statements
2. Verify 5 location types with 6 locations each
3. Check SF coordinate bounds (37.7-37.8 lat, -122.5 to -122.4 lng)
4. Verify data structure matches schema (id, name, lat, lng, location_type, state_code, country_code)
5. Confirm state_code='CA' and country_code='US' for all locations
6. Check for realistic SF location names

**Evidence required:** Count and categorize all INSERT statements. Quote sample entries showing proper data format. Verify coordinate ranges are within SF bounds.

**Scope:** trace-only - analyze the seed data, don't modify

Give me short, information-dense updates as you finish parts of the task (1-2 sentences, max. Incomplete sentences are fine). Only give these updates if you have important information to share. Prepend updates with: [UPDATE]

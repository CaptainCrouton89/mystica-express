I'll implement Tasks 2 and 4 for the loot enrichment plan. Let me start by reading the CombatService to understand the current structure.Good! I can see:
1. MaterialRepository is already imported (line 14)
2. materialRepository is already instantiated at module level (line 35)
3. The direct Supabase query for materials is at lines 1505-1523

Now let me check the constructor to see if materialRepository is injected:Perfect! MaterialRepository is already properly injected in the constructor (lines 218, 227). Now I just need to replace the direct Supabase query with a call to `this.materialRepository.findByIds()`.

Let me make the edit:Oh, I see there's a variable name collision - the code already has `materials` variable defined at line 1515. I need to rename my new variable:Perfect! Now let me verify the build passes:Excellent! Build passes. Let me verify the changes are correct by reviewing the modified section:Perfect! [UPDATE] Tasks 2 and 4 complete - Replaced direct Supabase query with `this.materialRepository.findByIds()` (lines 1505-1512), materialRepository already injected in constructor (line 227), build passes.

Summary of changes:
- ✅ Removed direct Supabase query for materials (lines 1507-1523 in original)
- ✅ Replaced with repository pattern: `await this.materialRepository.findByIds(materialIds)`
- ✅ Material enrichment preserved (lines 1515-1530): id, name, description, stat_modifiers, style_id, style_name
- ✅ Item enrichment unchanged (lines 1552-1571)
- ✅ Error handling unchanged: throws on missing material/itemtype
- ✅ Logging preserved with updated field names
- ✅ materialRepository already properly injected in constructor (Task 4 already satisfied)
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful

Task: Fix ItemService test mock issues
Instructions: Fix test failures in tests/unit/services/ItemService.test.ts where tests are failing because `this.profileRepository.findById is not a function`.

Context:
- Tests: "should successfully upgrade item and deduct gold" and "should perform manual transaction when RPC fails"
- Error: `DatabaseError: Database operation failed: this.profileRepository.findById is not a function`
- This is a mock setup issue, not a type issue

Steps:
1. Read tests/unit/services/ItemService.test.ts to find the "upgradeItem()" test block
2. Look at how profileRepository is mocked in the test setup
3. Add the missing `findById` mock to the profileRepository mock object
4. Check what the mock should return by looking at how it's used in src/services/ItemService.ts
5. Run the tests to verify: `pnpm test tests/unit/services/ItemService.test.ts`

Return a summary of what mock you added and what it returns.

I'll fix the failing tests in ItemService.test.ts by adding the missing `findById` mock to the profileRepository. Let me start by examining the test file and the service implementation.Now I need to examine the `upgradeItem()` test block to find the failing tests and look at how the profileRepository is mocked. Let me first look at the service implementation to see how `findById` is used:Let me continue reading the ItemService to see how `profileRepository.findById` is used:Now let me see the context around line 303 to understand how `findById` is used:Perfect! Now I can see that `profileRepository.findById` is used in the `upgradeItem` method. Let me check the ProfileRepository mock in the test file and add the missing `findById` method:

[UPDATE] Found the issue - profileRepository mock is missing the `findById` method that's used in upgradeItem()Now I need to add the mock return value for `findById` in the specific test cases. Let me look at the failing test "should successfully upgrade item and deduct gold" to see what it should return:I can see that the test expects `result.new_vanity_level` to be `nextLevel` (which is 4). Looking at the ItemService code, it uses `profile?.vanity_level || 0`, so I need to mock `findById` to return a profile object with the expected vanity level. Let me add this to the test:Now I need to find the second failing test "should perform manual transaction when RPC fails" and add the same mock:Now let me run the tests to verify the fix:Perfect! All tests are now passing. Let me provide a summary of what I did:

[UPDATE] Tests fixed successfully - added missing `findById` mock to profileRepository and configured return values

## Summary

I successfully fixed the failing tests in `tests/unit/services/ItemService.test.ts`. The issue was that the `profileRepository` mock was missing the `findById` method that the `upgradeItem()` method uses.

**What I fixed:**

1. **Added missing mock method**: Added `findById: jest.fn()` to the `ProfileRepository` mock in the test setup (line 80)

2. **Configured mock return values**: In both failing tests ("should successfully upgrade item and deduct gold" and "should perform manual transaction when RPC fails"), I added:
   ```typescript
   mockProfileRepository.findById.mockResolvedValue({ vanity_level: nextLevel });
   ```

**What the mock returns:**
The `findById` mock returns a profile object with a `vanity_level` property set to the `nextLevel` value (4 for the first test, 3 for the second test). This matches what the `upgradeItem()` method expects when it calls `profile?.vanity_level || 0` to set the `new_vanity_level` in the response.

The tests now run successfully with all 49 tests passing, confirming that the mock setup issue has been resolved.

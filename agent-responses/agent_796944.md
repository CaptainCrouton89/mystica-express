Task: Fix LoadoutRepository test mocks
Instructions: Fix all mock variable issues in tests/unit/repositories/LoadoutRepository.test.ts

The file uses `mockSupabase` but should use `mockClient` instead (which is properly set up in beforeEach).

Replace all instances of `mockSupabase.*` with proper `mockClient` chaining pattern.

Look at tests/unit/repositories/ItemRepository.test.ts for the correct pattern - it uses mockClient with proper method chaining.

Make sure all tests follow the same pattern where mockClient.from() returns a chainable query builder.

Give me short, information-dense updates as you finish parts of the task (1-2 sentences, max. Incomplete sentences are fine). Only give these updates if you have important information to share. Prepend updates with: [UPDATE]

I'll fix the mock variable issues in the LoadoutRepository test file by replacing `mockSupabase` with the proper `mockClient` pattern.Now I'll fix all instances of `mockSupabase` in the LoadoutRepository test file and replace them with proper `mockClient` chaining patterns.Let me fix this by breaking it down into more specific edits:Now let me continue with the rest of the replacements:[UPDATE] Replaced references to undefined `mockSupabase` with proper `mockClient` chaining in findLoadoutById tests.Let me continue fixing the remaining mockSupabase references systematically. I'll work through each section:I'll continue with the updateLoadoutName section. Since this is a single focused task, I won't use TodoWrite.Now I'll continue with the rest. Let me check how many more mockSupabase references need to be fixed:I need to continue fixing the remaining mockSupabase references. Let me work through them section by section:[UPDATE] Great! I can see the import was already changed from `mockSupabase.js` to `mockClient.js` and most of the direct variable usage was fixed. I need to fix the remaining method chaining patterns where methods are called directly on `mockClient` instead of being properly chained.

Let me fix the remaining issues with proper chaining:Now I need to fix the delete operations and other direct method calls. Let me continue:I can see the constructor was also fixed. Let me check the current state and continue with the remaining fixes:Now I need to fix all these direct method calls. Let me work through them systematically:[UPDATE] Fixed delete and select operations to use proper chaining. Continuing with the bulk update operations.

Let me continue with the updateLoadoutSlots section which has complex mocking:I see the import was reverted. Let me check the current state and run the tests to see what still needs to be fixed:Perfect! I can see the current state of the test failures. All the remaining issues are still using direct method calls like `mockClient.delete.mockResolvedValue` instead of proper chaining. Let me fix them systematically by working through the remaining ones. I'll run a batch replace instead of going one by one.

Let me first check how the PetRepository test was fixed to understand the correct pattern:I see - the PetRepository test is using a different pattern with direct mocking of the supabase import. Let me check what the correct pattern should be by looking at the mockSupabase helper:Perfect! Now I understand the pattern. The PetRepository is using a different approach where it creates a comprehensive `mockQuery` object with chained methods. Let me update the LoadoutRepository test to use a similar pattern where I create a proper mockClient that has the right method chaining structure.Actually, I have a mistake in my approach. Let me fix the beforeEach to create a proper mock pattern like ItemRepository uses:Now let me check if the createMockSupabaseClient from the helper already provides the right structure. The problem is that the tests are using direct method calls like `mockClient.delete.mockResolvedValue` which suggests they expect `mockClient` to have these methods directly. But according to the helper, they should be accessed via the chained query builder returned by `from()`.

Let me run a quick test to see if my current changes fixed some of the issues:Good progress! The tests that use proper chaining are now passing, but the ones with direct method calls are still failing. Let me fix these systematically. The main issue is that I need to replace all direct method calls on `mockClient` with proper chaining through `mockClient.from()`.

Let me batch replace the remaining broken tests:I need to fix these individually due to duplicates. Let me handle them one by one with specific context:Let me read the current file again to see the exact content:Now I can see the exact content. Let me fix this section:Now let me continue with the next test:Let me continue with the remaining tests. I'll do this more efficiently by using a script to find and replace all remaining instances. Let me finish the major ones manually:I need to fix the TypeScript errors first by adding proper typing:Now let me run the test again to see the remaining failures:Great progress! Now we have 21 passing tests and 16 failing. I need to fix the remaining ones quickly. Let me batch replace the remaining broken direct method calls:The agent is working on fixing the remaining test failures. Let me wait for it to complete:Excellent! I can see the agent completed the task. Let me check the final test results:Great progress! Now we have 34 passing tests and only 3 failing. The issue is with how the count results are being mocked. The repository is expecting the count directly but the mocks are returning it in a different format. Let me fix these last 3 issues:I can see the issue. The repository code uses `{ count: 'exact', head: true }` which means the count is returned directly as `{ count: N, error: null }`, not wrapped in a data array. Let me fix the remaining 3 failing tests:I can see the issue. The mocks are returning `{ data: [{ count: 0 }], error: null }` but the repository expects `{ count: 0, error: null }` directly. Let me fix this:I can see the issue now. The mocks are returning `{ data: [{ count: 0 }], error: null }` but the repository expects `{ count: 0, error: null }` directly because it uses `{ count: 'exact', head: true }`. Let me fix these:Let me run a simple batch replace for all the problematic count patterns:Let me run the test quickly to see if the agent's changes have resolved the issues:I still have the same 3 failing tests. The count format is still wrong. Let me check the exact line number and fix these directly. The issue is that the mock is still returning `{ data: [{ count: N }], error: null }` but it should return `{ count: N, error: null }`.Perfect! Now I can fix these quickly with a targeted replacement:Now let me run the final test to confirm all issues are resolved:I still have the same 3 failing tests. There must still be some issues with the count mock returns. Let me debug this by checking what actual format the repository is expecting. Let me look at the repository code again:Perfect! Now I can see the issue. The repository methods like `isLoadoutNameUnique` and `validateLoadoutOwnership` use `{ count: 'exact', head: true }` which means they get the count directly. The mock chains need to be set up to properly return the count result. Let me look at the specific lines in the test file:I see the issue now! The problem is that the query uses `{ count: 'exact', head: true }` which means instead of calling `.count()`, the count is returned directly from the query. But the mock chains are set up wrong. Let me look at how the repository actually calls this:

The repository does `await query` directly (line 507), not `await query.count()`. So the mock should be set up differently. The `count` should be the final resolved value, not a method call.Perfect! Now I can see the issue. Looking at the current tests, I can see that the ones that are fixed use the correct pattern where the final `.eq()` resolves directly to `{ count: N, error: null }`. Let me check which tests are still failing and fix the inconsistent ones:

Lines 657 and 673 still have the old `.count()` method pattern. Let me fix these:Now let me fix the neq pattern for the exclude test:That one looks correct already. Now let me run the tests to see if they pass:ðŸŽ‰ **Perfect! All tests are now passing!**

Let me also run the PetRepository tests to make sure they still work:The PetRepository tests have some issues, but they are unrelated to our LoadoutRepository fixes. The LoadoutRepository tests are now **fully working** with **37/37 tests passing**.

## Summary

I successfully fixed all mock variable issues in the LoadoutRepository test file by:

1. **Replaced `mockSupabase` with `mockClient`**: Updated all references to use the properly initialized `mockClient` instead of the undefined `mockSupabase` variable.

2. **Fixed method chaining patterns**: Converted all direct method calls like `mockClient.delete.mockResolvedValue()` to proper Supabase query builder chaining patterns like:
   ```typescript
   mockClient.from.mockReturnValue({
     delete: jest.fn().mockReturnValue({
       eq: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue({ error: null })
     })
   });
   ```

3. **Corrected count operation mocking**: Fixed the special case where repository methods use `{ count: 'exact', head: true }` which returns the count directly as `{ count: N, error: null }` rather than wrapped in a data array.

4. **Used proper TypeScript typing**: Added proper string types to `mockImplementation` callback parameters to resolve TypeScript errors.

The key insight was understanding that Supabase queries with `{ count: 'exact', head: true }` return the count directly in the response object, not as a separate method call, which required different mock setup patterns.

**Final Result**: All 37 LoadoutRepository tests now pass, demonstrating proper mock setup for complex Supabase query chains including count operations, multiple table operations, and proper error handling scenarios.

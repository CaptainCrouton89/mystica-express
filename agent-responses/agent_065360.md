I'll fix the auth-device integration test to use the extractResponseData helper for the response wrapper middleware. Let me start by examining the test file.Now I can see the issue. The test is already importing `extractResponseData` from the helpers, but there are two places where it's still accessing `response.body.user` directly instead of using the helper. Let me examine the specific lines mentioned:

- Line 301: `expect(response.body.user)` 
- Line 345: `expect(response.body.user)`

Let me fix these issues:[UPDATE] Fixed both direct response.body.user accesses on lines 301 and 345 to use extractResponseData helper.

Now let me check if there are any other direct accesses to `response.body` that should use the helper instead:I can see there are several other `response.body` accesses, but they are accessing error objects and checking for session data in conditional statements. Let me also check for successful response data accesses that might need the helper:I see there are two places where `response.body.session` is accessed directly. These should also use the `extractResponseData` helper since they're accessing successful response data. Let me fix these:[UPDATE] Fixed remaining response.body.session accesses to use extractResponseData helper.

Now let me run the test to verify all fixes work correctly:Perfect! All tests are now passing. Let me do a final verification by checking that all the changes I made are consistent with the response wrapper middleware pattern:Excellent! The fix is complete and working correctly. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

## ✅ Task Completed Successfully

**Fixed 4 instances** of direct `response.body` access for successful responses:

1. **Line 301**: Changed `response.body.user` → `extractResponseData(response.body).user`
2. **Line 345**: Changed `response.body.user` → `extractResponseData(response.body).user` 
3. **Line 243-244**: Changed `response.body.session?.access_token` → `extractResponseData(response.body).session?.access_token`
4. **Line 407-408**: Changed `response.body.session` → `extractResponseData(response.body).session`

**Preserved error handling**: Left direct `response.body.error` accesses unchanged since error responses don't go through the response wrapper middleware.

**Test Results**: All 13 tests now pass ✅

The auth-device integration test now correctly uses the `extractResponseData` helper to unwrap the response wrapper middleware format, making it consistent with the new response structure across the Express backend.

**Assistant:** [exited]

I'll fix the MaterialRepository test mock data structure issue. Let me start by examining the failing test and the implementation.Now let me examine the MaterialRepository implementation to understand the expected RPC response structure:I need to see more of the RPC call structure to understand the full expected response:Perfect! Now I understand the issue. The implementation expects the RPC to return a structured response with `{ success: boolean, data?: {...}, error_code?: string, message?: string }`, but the mock is returning the raw `rpcResult` directly.

Let me check what `rpcResult` contains to see what needs to be wrapped:Now I understand the complete structure. The `rpcResult` is an array with the RPC response data, but the implementation expects it to be wrapped in the envelope structure. Let me fix the mock:

[UPDATE] Found the issue - mock returns raw RPC data but implementation expects `{success: true, data: {...}}` envelope structure.Let me provide more context to make it unique to the specific test case:Now let me run the test to verify the fix works:The test is still failing, but now with a different error. It's expecting `result.newStackQuantity` to be 4, but it's getting 0. Let me examine how the implementation processes the RPC result to understand what's missing.I see the issue now! The implementation calls `this.findStackByUser(userId, materialId, styleId)` to get the updated stack quantity after the RPC call. The test needs to mock that call as well. Let me check the current test to see if it's missing that mock:I need to add a mock for the `findStackByUser` call. Let me look at the `findStackByUser` method to understand what structure it expects:I need to add a mock for the `findStackByUser` call that will return a stack with quantity 4. Let me add this mock:

[UPDATE] Need to mock `findStackByUser` call that returns updated stack quantity after RPC operation.Now let me run the test again to verify the fix:There's still an issue. The test is now returning the stack data instead of the instance data. This suggests that the mocking isn't working correctly. Let me examine how the `findInstanceById` method works and see if there's a conflict in the mock chains:I see the issue now. The mock setup is conflicting because both queries are on the `materialinstances` table but with different constraints. Let me examine the exact query structure:Let me look at the `findInstanceById` method implementation:Let me find the `findInstanceById` method:The issue is clear now. The mocking setup is causing conflicts because the mock chain is being overridden. Let me fix this by setting up the mock for `findInstanceById` first, and then setting up a separate mock for the stack query. The key issue is that both calls are to `materialinstances` table, but the second call (for stack) should be to `materialstacks` table.

Looking at the error, it seems the mock for `materialstacks` is being returned for the `materialinstances` query. Let me reorder the mocks and make sure they're set up correctly:Now let me run the test again to see if this fixes the mock chain conflicts:The issue persists. The test is still returning the stack data instead of the instance data. Let me examine the exact mock setup being used in other tests to understand the pattern better:I see that other tests are using the same pattern, but they work. Let me check if there's an issue with how Jest's mock chaining works. The problem might be that Jest is applying mocks in order and my subsequent mock is overriding the first one. Let me try a different approach using `mockReturnValueOnce` for better specificity:Let me run the test again to see if `mockResolvedValueOnce` fixes the issue:Perfect! The test is now passing. Let me run the test once more to confirm it's consistently working:

[UPDATE] Fixed MaterialRepository test - corrected RPC mock envelope structure and used `mockResolvedValueOnce` to prevent mock chain conflicts.Excellent! The fix is working consistently. 

## Summary

I successfully fixed the MaterialRepository test mock data structure issue. The problem was twofold:

1. **Incorrect RPC response envelope structure**: The mock was returning raw RPC data directly, but the implementation expected it wrapped in a structured envelope: `{ success: true, data: {...}, error_code: null, message: null }`

2. **Mock chain conflicts**: Jest was experiencing conflicts between multiple mocks on similar query chains. Using `mockResolvedValueOnce` instead of `mockResolvedValue` resolved the timing conflicts.

**Changes made:**
- Updated the RPC mock to return the correct envelope structure with `success: true` and proper `data` nesting
- Added a mock for the `findStackByUser` call that returns the updated stack quantity (4)
- Used `mockResolvedValueOnce` to ensure proper mock sequencing for the two separate database queries

The test now passes consistently, validating that the `applyMaterialToItemAtomic` method correctly processes RPC responses and returns both the material instance and updated stack quantity.

**Assistant:** [exited]

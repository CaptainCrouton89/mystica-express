Task: Update profile-init documentation
Instructions: Update the documentation for the profile-init feature with new requirements:

**Current Requirements (to be changed):**
- Creates 6 level-1 items
- Starting gold: 500

**New Requirements:**
- Starting gold: **0 gold** (zero)
- Starting inventory: **1 item only** - a random common rarity item with no materials applied

**Files to Update:**
1. `/Users/silasrhyneer/Code/new-mystica/docs/api-contracts.yaml` - Line 1605 description
2. `/Users/silasrhyneer/Code/new-mystica/docs/feature-specs/F-07-authentication.yaml` - Any references to starter items/gold
3. Check if any other documentation references starter inventory or initial gold amounts

**Requirements:**
- Change all references from "6 level-1 items, 500 gold" to "1 random common item (no materials), 0 gold"
- Update the description to clarify it's a random common rarity item
- Maintain YAML formatting conventions (2-space indent)
- Keep all traceability links intact
- Do NOT update any code files, only documentation

**Output Required:**
Return a summary of:
1. Which files you updated
2. What specific changes you made to each file (before/after snippets)
3. Any other documentation that mentions starter inventory that might need updating

Give me short, information-dense updates as you finish parts of the task (1-2 sentences, max. Incomplete sentences are fine). Only give these updates if you have important information to share. Prepend updates with: [UPDATE]

I'll help you update the documentation for the profile-init feature with the new requirements. Let me start by examining the current documentation to understand what needs to be changed.Now let me search for any other references to starter inventory or initial gold amounts across the documentation:Let me check specifically for the data-plan.yaml reference to the 500 gold initialization:Let me also check the US-601 user story reference that mentioned "starter inventory (empty)":[UPDATE] Found key documentation files that need updating - api-contracts.yaml, data-plan.yaml, and US-601 already mentions "empty" starter inventory which aligns with new requirements.

Now I'll make the necessary updates to change the requirements from "6 level-1 items, 500 gold" to "1 random common item, 0 gold":Let me find the correct section in data-plan.yaml:Now let me check if the US-601 user story needs any updates. The current text says "default starter inventory (empty)" which actually already aligns with the new requirements, but let me see if I should clarify it to mention the single item:Let me search for any other references to the profile initialization or starter inventory in feature specifications:Let me check if the system-design.yaml has any details about the profile initialization that need updating:The system-design.yaml reference is just showing the flow without specifics about what gets initialized, so it doesn't need updating. Let me do a final check to see if there are any other explicit mentions of the "6 level-1 items" or similar in any documentation:[UPDATE] Found F-03 mentions "Players start with 8 level-1 base items (one per slot)" - this needs updating to match new requirements.Let me also check if there are any detailed implementation notes in that feature spec that mention the initial equipment setup:Perfect! Now let me do a final validation check to make sure I haven't missed any other references. Let me also check the api-contracts file to see if there are any other references to starter items:[UPDATE] All documentation files updated successfully. Running final validation to ensure traceability links remain intact.

Let me run a quick validation to make sure the documentation still passes the project checks:Excellent! The documentation validation passed with only one unrelated warning about F-07 summary being empty. All traceability links remain intact.

## Summary

I have successfully updated the documentation for the profile-init feature with the new requirements. Here are the specific changes made:

### Files Updated:

1. **`/Users/silasrhyneer/Code/new-mystica/docs/api-contracts.yaml`** (2 changes):
   - **Line 1605**: Changed description from `"Creates starting inventory (6 level-1 items, 500 gold)"` to `"Creates starting inventory (1 random common rarity item with no materials, 0 gold)"`
   - **Line 1610**: Changed response description from `"Profile created with starter items"` to `"Profile created with starter inventory (1 random common item, 0 gold)"`

2. **`/Users/silasrhyneer/Code/new-mystica/docs/data-plan.yaml`** (1 change):
   - **Line 1357**: Changed `"UserCurrencyBalances (initialized with 500 GOLD per user)"` to `"UserCurrencyBalances (initialized with 0 GOLD per user)"`

3. **`/Users/silasrhyneer/Code/new-mystica/docs/user-stories/US-601-user-registration.yaml`** (1 change):
   - **Line 26**: Updated technical notes from `"User profile created with default starter inventory (empty), level 1, starting stats"` to `"User profile created with starter inventory (1 random common item with no materials), level 1, starting stats, 0 gold"`

4. **`/Users/silasrhyneer/Code/new-mystica/docs/feature-specs/F-03-base-items-equipment.yaml`** (1 change):
   - **Line 7**: Updated summary from `"Players start with 8 level-1 base items (one per slot)"` to `"Players start with 1 random common rarity item (no materials applied) and 0 gold"`

### Changes Summary:
- **Before**: 6 level-1 items + 500 gold starting inventory
- **After**: 1 random common rarity item (no materials) + 0 gold starting inventory

All traceability links remain intact and the documentation validation passes successfully. The changes consistently update all references to the new simplified starting inventory requirements across the API contracts, data planning, user stories, and feature specifications.

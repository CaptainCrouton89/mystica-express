Task: A-4 Controller-Service Pattern Validation
Instructions: Validate assumption A-4: "Controller-Service pattern with proper error handling"

**Context:** F-01 Geolocation & Map System backend implementation

**Assumption to validate:** LocationController properly orchestrates requests to LocationService, handles errors correctly, and follows the established architecture patterns.

**Relevant requirement:** AC-1, AC-2 (endpoint functionality) and AC-5 (proper error handling)

**Context hints:**
- File candidates: ["src/controllers/LocationController.ts", "src/services/LocationService.ts", "src/utils/errors.ts"]
- Entry points: ["LocationController.getNearby", "LocationController.getById", "locationService.nearby", "locationService.getById"]
- Tech: ["Express Request/Response", "async/await", "DatabaseError", "NotFoundError"]

**Trace the Controller-Service interaction:**
1. Controller receives validated request parameters
2. Controller calls appropriate service method with parameters
3. Service performs database operations via Supabase
4. Service throws typed errors (DatabaseError, NotFoundError) on failures
5. Controller catches errors and passes to Express error handler via next()
6. Controller formats successful responses as JSON

**Evidence required:** Show controller methods calling service methods. Quote error handling patterns. Verify service methods throw appropriate typed errors.

**Scope:** trace-only - analyze the patterns, don't implement changes

Task: Fix MaterialService.test.ts types
Instructions: Fix the TypeScript compilation errors in tests/unit/services/MaterialService.test.ts

The errors are:
- Line 641: `Property 'theme' does not exist on type 'Material'`
- Line 656: `Property 'theme' does not exist on type 'Material'`

Reference files:
- tests/unit/services/MaterialService.test.ts - The failing test
- src/types/api.types.ts - API type definitions
- src/types/database.types.ts - Database type definitions
- src/services/MaterialService.ts - The service implementation

Figure out the correct Material type structure and fix the test to match actual type definitions.

Give me short, information-dense updates as you finish parts of the task (1-2 sentences, max. Incomplete sentences are fine). Only give these updates if you have important information to share. Prepend updates with: [UPDATE]

I'll investigate the Material type structure and fix the TypeScript compilation errors.[UPDATE] Found the database Material type - it doesn't have a `theme` property. Only has: id, name, description, stat_modifiers, base_drop_weight, created_at.[UPDATE] API types confirm Material interface has no `theme` property. The test is incorrectly expecting a `theme` field that doesn't exist in the actual type definitions.[UPDATE] Found the source of the issue! In `seedData.ts` line 132, `transformSeedMaterial` adds a hardcoded `theme: 'balanced'` property that doesn't exist in the actual Material interface from the database.[UPDATE] Found another type issue - the test helper `expectValidMaterial` is also expecting a `rarity` property that doesn't exist in the Material interface.[UPDATE] Found more rarity references in seedData.ts that need fixing.[UPDATE] Fixed the Material type issues! Now tests are failing on mock implementation problems - the Supabase client mocks don't have the proper chaining methods like `.gt()`, `.select()`, etc. This is the same mocking approach issue the agent mentioned.

Fixed:
- Removed `theme` and `rarity` properties from Material type usage
- Updated seedData transformations to match actual database schema
- Fixed test assertions to use correct Material properties

The TypeScript compilation errors are resolved!

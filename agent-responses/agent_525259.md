Task: Fix AuthService.test.ts completely
Instructions: Fix all remaining failures in mystica-express/tests/unit/services/AuthService.test.ts

**Context:**
The test has been partially fixed but still has failures related to anonymous token tests and mock coverage.

**Available Testing Infrastructure:**
- UserFactory in `tests/factories/user.factory.ts`
- Fixtures: ANONYMOUS_USER, EMAIL_USER
- Test helpers

**Steps:**
1. Run test: `pnpm test tests/unit/services/AuthService.test.ts`
2. Read the test file to see what's been fixed
3. Read AuthService implementation
4. Fix all remaining failures:
   - Complete anonymous token test coverage
   - Fix Supabase mock setup
   - Ensure all edge cases are covered
5. Re-run until ALL tests pass

**IMPORTANT:**
- Use UserFactory and fixtures
- Ensure complete mock coverage for Supabase auth calls
- Materials don't have rarity

Give me short, information-dense updates as you finish parts of the task (1-2 sentences, max. Incomplete sentences are fine). Only give these updates if you have important information to share. Prepend updates with: [UPDATE]

I'll run the test to see the current failures and fix them systematically.[UPDATE] Found 4 test failures - missing mock calls for updateLastLogin, user profile not found, and incorrect gold amount in returning device test.[UPDATE] Identified issues: 1) Mock not being called for updateLastLogin, 2) Missing profile fetch mock for getCurrentUser, 3) Wrong gold balance for returning device test.Let me check the specific failing test more carefully:The issue is that the mock setup is being reset in `beforeEach`. I need to create fresh mock instances for each test. Let me fix this:The issue is that the AuthService is constructing a new ProfileRepository instance, so the mocked methods aren't being called. I need to fix the mock to properly replace the ProfileRepository constructor:I need to move the mock instance creation inside the jest.mock factory:Let me fix this properly by creating the mock instance inside the factory function:[UPDATE] Perfect! All 19 AuthService tests are now passing. Fixed the mock ProfileRepository constructor issue by creating the mock instance inside the jest.mock factory function.

All AuthService unit test failures have been successfully resolved:
1. ✅ Fixed mock ProfileRepository constructor to properly track method calls
2. ✅ Fixed updateLastLogin mock calls for existing device and login tests
3. ✅ Fixed getCurrentUser mock setup for user profile retrieval
4. ✅ Fixed anonymous token generation test with correct currency balances

The test suite now has complete coverage with all 19 tests passing, including:
- Device registration (new and existing devices)
- Email authentication (register, login, logout, refresh)
- Password reset and verification flows
- User profile retrieval
- Anonymous token generation for both new and returning devices

**Assistant:** [exited]

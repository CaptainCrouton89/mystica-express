Task: Fix ItemService test type errors
Instructions: Fix the type errors in tests/unit/services/ItemService.test.ts where `new_level` and `stat_increase` properties do not exist on type `UpgradeResult`.

Context:
- Errors at lines 730, 735-738: Properties `new_level` and `stat_increase` do not exist on type `UpgradeResult`
- Location: tests/unit/services/ItemService.test.ts

Steps:
1. Read tests/unit/services/ItemService.test.ts around lines 730-738
2. Read src/services/ItemService.ts to see what UpgradeResult type actually returns
3. Read src/types/api.types.ts or wherever UpgradeResult is defined
4. Fix the test assertions to use the correct property names from the actual UpgradeResult type

Return a summary of what you fixed and the correct property names.

Give me short, information-dense updates as you finish parts of the task (1-2 sentences, max. Incomplete sentences are fine). Only give these updates if you have important information to share. Prepend updates with: [UPDATE]

I'll fix the type errors in the ItemService test by identifying the correct property names from the UpgradeResult type and updating the test assertions.[UPDATE] Found UpgradeResult type definition - it uses `new_gold_balance` and `new_vanity_level` instead of `new_level` and `stat_increase`Let me search for the upgradeItem method in ItemService to see what it actually returns:Now I can see the correct return structure. Let me fix the test assertions:Let me also check if there are any other similar issues in the test file:These other instances of `new_level` appear to be in different contexts (RPC call data and event data), not related to the UpgradeResult type errors. Let me verify the compilation now:The ItemService test errors are fixed, but there are other TypeScript errors. Let me verify just the ItemService test file compiles:The Zod errors are unrelated to our specific test file. Let me run the specific test to verify our fix works:Great! The original type errors related to `new_level` and `stat_increase` have been fixed. The test is now failing due to a different issue (missing mock for `profileRepository.findById`), but the TypeScript type errors we were asked to fix are resolved.

Let me verify that the specific lines we fixed are working correctly by checking the compilation output for those lines:Perfect! The fixes are correctly implemented.

## Summary

I successfully fixed the TypeScript errors in `tests/unit/services/ItemService.test.ts` at lines 730-738. The issues were:

**Fixed Type Errors:**
1. **Line 730**: Changed `result.new_level` to `result.new_vanity_level` to match the actual `UpgradeResult` interface
2. **Lines 735-738**: Replaced the non-existent `result.stat_increase` property assertions with validation of the actual `result.updated_item.current_stats` properties

**Correct Property Names from UpgradeResult:**
- ✅ `success: boolean`
- ✅ `updated_item: Item` 
- ✅ `gold_spent: number`
- ✅ `new_gold_balance: number`
- ✅ `new_vanity_level: number` (NOT `new_level`)

The `UpgradeResult` type doesn't include `new_level` or `stat_increase` properties. Instead, it provides `new_vanity_level` and the updated item with its current stats, which is what the test now correctly validates.

**Assistant:** [exited]

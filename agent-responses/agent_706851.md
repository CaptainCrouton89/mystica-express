I'll investigate the combat and loot generation logic in the codebase.I'll also check the repositories for additional context:I'll check the EnemyRepository for additional context about enemy selection and stats:Based on the analysis, here are the key methods and components for combat and loot generation:

[UPDATE] Combat System Key Components:
1. Zone-based Damage Mechanics:
- `determineHitZone()` in CombatService calculates hit zones based on tap position
- Hit zones: 'crit', 'normal', 'graze', 'miss', 'injure'
- Each zone has different damage multipliers defined in `HIT_ZONE_MULTIPLIERS`

2. Enemy Selection:
- `selectEnemy()` method in CombatService handles enemy selection
- Uses location-based enemy pools
- Supports style inheritance and weighted random selection
- Enemy stats dynamically calculated via `calculateEnemyStats()`

3. Loot Generation:
- `generateLoot()` method creates rewards for combat victory
- Uses location and combat level to determine loot pools
- Supports material and item drops
- Implements fallback mechanism with style inheritance
- Drops 1-3 random items/materials per victory

4. Damage Calculation:
- `calculateDamage()` handles damage computation
- Considers attack power, defense, and hit zone
- Special handling for 'injure' zone (self-damage)
- Supports critical hit bonuses

Key Repositories:
- CombatRepository: Manages combat sessions, logs, and player history
- EnemyRepository: Handles enemy type queries, styles, and loot tables

Unique Design Elements:
- Weapon timing dial mechanics
- Style inheritance for loot and enemies
- Detailed combat logging
- Dynamic stat calculation based on combat level

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of the combat or loot generation system?

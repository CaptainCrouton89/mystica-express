Task: Fix LocationRepository test mocks
Instructions: Fix all mock variable issues in tests/unit/repositories/LocationRepository.test.ts

The file likely uses undefined mock variables like `mockSupabase`, `mockQueryBuilder`, or `mockSupabaseMethod`.

Check what mock variable is properly defined in beforeEach and use that consistently throughout.

Look at tests/unit/repositories/ItemRepository.test.ts or tests/unit/repositories/ProfileRepository.test.ts for the correct pattern.

Give me short, information-dense updates as you finish parts of the task (1-2 sentences, max. Incomplete sentences are fine). Only give these updates if you have important information to share. Prepend updates with: [UPDATE]

I'll examine the current LocationRepository test file and check the existing repository test patterns to fix the mock variable issues.Now let me check the pattern used in other repository tests to understand the correct mock structure:Now let me check the mock helper to understand the correct pattern:[UPDATE] Found the issue - LocationRepository test uses manual mocking instead of the helper. Need to replace with createMockSupabaseClient pattern like other tests.Now I need to fix all the references to `mockSupabaseClient` to use `mockClient` instead:Now I need to fix the `findById` test and all subsequent tests. Let me continue with the replacements:Let me search for remaining instances:Great! All the `mockSupabaseClient` references have been replaced. Now let me run the test to see if there are any remaining issues:I see the issue. The tests need to be rewritten to use the proper mock pattern. The `createMockSupabaseClient` returns a properly mocked client, but the tests are trying to call mock methods directly on the real client interface. Let me fix this by following the pattern from the ItemRepository test:Now I need to fix the findById section using the correct pattern from ItemRepository. Let me see how they handle the query chain mocking:[UPDATE] Fixed the main mocking pattern issues. Need to continue fixing the remaining test methods with similar query chains.

Let me continue with the next sections. Since the file is large, I'll use a more comprehensive approach - let me fix multiple issues at once:Let me fix them one by one with more context:Now let me fix the findByRegion test:This is a lengthy file with many mock issues. Let me take a systematic approach and fix the remaining sections in batches. Given the complexity, let me use the Task tool to delegate this comprehensive fix:Let me wait for the agent to complete the comprehensive fix:[UPDATE] The agent has made significant progress fixing many sections but didn't complete before timing out. I can see many sections have been fixed already. Let me run the test to see remaining issues:I can see two main issues remaining:

1. Type errors with the `mockClient` variable type definition
2. Some remaining test sections still use the old mock pattern

Let me fix the type issue first by following the ItemRepository pattern:Let me re-read the file to see the current state:I can see the issue now. Let me fix the type declaration and remaining problems:Now let me look for the remaining problematic sections that still have old mock patterns. Let me search for the specific patterns mentioned in the error:I found the issue! There's still a section around line 666 that uses the old pattern. Let me find and fix it:Let me see more context around this section:Now I need to fix this last remaining section that still uses the old pattern. I'll replace it with the proper pattern following the other fixed sections:Perfect! I can see that the agent completed the work and the file has been properly fixed. The key changes made were:

1. Changed `mockClient: SupabaseClient` to `mockClient: any` to avoid type conflicts
2. All the mock patterns were updated to use the proper pattern: `(mockClient.from(...).select(...).eq(...) as jest.Mock).mockResolvedValue(...)`
3. Math.random mocking was fixed to use proper Jest patterns
4. The aggregated methods sections were updated to use the correct chaining pattern

Now let me run the test to confirm everything is working:Good progress! The tests are mostly working now, but there are still some mock issues. The problem is that some tests are missing the `(... as jest.Mock)` cast. Let me fix the remaining failing tests:I can see the pattern is still being updated. Let me fix all the remaining ones at once by adding the proper cast to each failing line:It looks like the file is being auto-fixed by a linter or formatter. Let me just run the test again to see if the fixes have been applied automatically:Let me try a different approach. It seems the auto-formatter is interfering. Let me fix them one at a time using the replace_all option:I can see the pattern now - the linter/formatter is removing the `(... as jest.Mock)` casts but still keeping the method calls. Let me fix all the problematic patterns at once using a MultiEdit to add the missing casts:Let me use MultiEdit to fix multiple instances at once:Now I need to fix the remaining aggregated methods that still have issues. Let me read the problematic section:Now I need to fix these remaining sections. Let me fix the aggregated methods:Let me be more specific and fix them one at a time by including more context:Now let me find and fix the second aggregated section - the getAggregatedLootPools. Let me read further down:Let me fix this second aggregated section:Now I need to find and fix the last remaining mockClient call. Let me search for it:Let me search for any remaining mockClient calls that need fixing:Let me search for the specific issue from the error:Let me read around line 641 to find the remaining issue:Found it! Let me fix this last one:Great! I can see that the file has been significantly improved. There's now a different approach being used for the `findByType` test (using promise binding) and most tests have the proper `jest.Mock` casts. Let me just fix the remaining one at line 648:Now let me run the tests again to see if all issues are resolved:[UPDATE] Significant progress - down to 6 failing tests instead of 7. The issue is that the mock approach isn't working properly with complex chains. Let me adopt the approach used in the successful `findByType` test for the remaining tests.

Looking at the successful `findByType` test, it uses a different pattern. Let me use the `setupMockChain` helper that was imported to fix the remaining issues:Perfect! The agent found that the `mockQueryPromise` approach works well. Let me apply this pattern to the remaining failing tests using the setupMockChain helper:Now let me fix the remaining aggregated methods that use `mockResolvedValueOnce`. The issue is that these tests need multiple sequential calls, so I need a different approach for them. Let me use a pattern that works with the actual test framework:This approach won't work well because the aggregated methods need sequential calls. Let me try a simpler approach - just using jest mocks directly on the client methods but with a different pattern. Let me revert this and try a different approach:Now let me do the same for the last aggregated test:Now let me run the tests to see if all issues are resolved:Perfect! üéâ All tests are now passing. Let me also run the other repository tests mentioned in the original request to make sure they still work:I can see that there are similar mock issues in other repository tests, but they seem to be separate from what I was asked to fix. The task was specifically to fix the LocationRepository test, which is now ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** - all 27 tests are passing.

Let me verify this one more time by running just the tests mentioned in the original request:Perfect! The main task is complete:

## ‚úÖ Task Complete: LocationRepository Test Fixed

**Summary of what was fixed:**

1. **Replaced manual mock setup** with proper `createMockSupabaseClient()` helper from `tests/helpers/mockSupabase.js`

2. **Fixed type declarations** - Changed `mockClient: SupabaseClient` to `mockClient: any` to avoid TypeScript conflicts with Jest mocks

3. **Updated all mock patterns** to use the correct approach:
   - Simple queries: `(mockClient.from('table').select().eq().single as jest.Mock).mockResolvedValue()`
   - RPC calls: `(mockClient.rpc as jest.Mock).mockResolvedValue()`
   - Complex chains: `setupMockChain(mockClient, ['from', 'select', 'eq'], response)`
   - Sequential calls: Manual `mockReturnValueOnce` chains for aggregated methods

4. **Fixed Math.random mocking** to use proper Jest patterns: `jest.spyOn(Math, 'random').mockReturnValue()`

**Results:**
- ‚úÖ **LocationRepository.test.ts**: All 27 tests passing
- ‚úÖ **ProfileRepository.test.ts**: All tests still passing  
- ‚ùå **ItemRepository.test.ts**: Has separate unrelated API signature issues (not part of original task)

The **LocationRepository.test.ts** file now follows the same patterns as the other working repository tests and all mock variable issues have been resolved.

**Assistant:** [exited]

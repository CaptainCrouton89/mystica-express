Task: Fix ItemService.test.ts types
Instructions: Fix the TypeScript compilation errors in tests/unit/services/ItemService.test.ts

The error is:
- Line 890: `Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'rarity' does not exist in type 'Material'`

Reference files:
- tests/unit/services/ItemService.test.ts - The failing test
- src/types/api.types.ts - API type definitions
- src/types/database.types.ts - Database type definitions

Figure out the correct Material type structure and fix the test data to match.

Give me short, information-dense updates as you finish parts of the task (1-2 sentences, max. Incomplete sentences are fine). Only give these updates if you have important information to share. Prepend updates with: [UPDATE]

I'll examine the test file and type definitions to fix the TypeScript compilation error.Let me search for the Materials table definition in the database types:Found it! Let me get the full materials table definition:[UPDATE] Found the issue: database Material type doesn't have `rarity` field, only `base_drop_weight`, `name`, `stat_modifiers`, etc.

Now I need to check what the API Material type is supposed to map to and fix the test:Now let me verify the TypeScript compilation by running the build:There are still TypeScript errors in the ItemRepository test file. Let me check what's happening there:The lines look normal. Let me check around line 642 and 669 more specifically:Let me check the broader context. The error seems to be about missing closing braces or parentheses:I think I see the issue. It looks like there are missing closing parentheses. Let me check the ItemService test that I was asked to fix to make sure it compiles:The error shows there are many TypeScript errors related to missing `rarity` property on Material types throughout the test files. I can see that my fix for the ItemService.test.ts worked, but there are many other test files with the same issue. Let me focus on fixing the primary issue that was requested - the ItemService.test.ts file - and verify it compiles correctly by running just that test:Let me try a different approach to check just the ItemService test compilation:[UPDATE] Fixed the Material type issue in ItemService.test.ts by removing the invalid `rarity` property and replacing it with `base_drop_weight` to match the database schema.

The specific issue was resolved:
- Line 890: Removed `rarity: 'common'` and `theme: 'defensive'` properties
- Added `base_drop_weight: 1.0` to match the actual Material database type

The TypeScript compilation error for the ItemService test file has been fixed. The Material type in the database only includes `id`, `name`, `stat_modifiers`, and `base_drop_weight` - not `rarity` which was being incorrectly used in the test data.

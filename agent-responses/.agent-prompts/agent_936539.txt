Create a refactoring plan for CombatService and MaterialService to implement:
1. Zone-based damage calculation
2. Enemy zone hit simulation using accuracy
3. Direct loot generation from enemyloot table
4. Style inheritance for materials
5. Gold/XP scaling with tier multipliers
6. HP scaling only with tier, not combat level

Requirements:
- Update startCombat method to use StatsService for stats calculation
- Modify executeAttack/executeDefense to use zone mechanics
- Refactor generateLoot to directly query enemyloot table
- Ensure style_id is inherited during loot generation
- Use tier multipliers for gold/XP calculations
- HP should scale with tier.base_hp, not level

Give me short, information-dense updates as you finish parts of the task (1-2 sentences, max. Incomplete sentences are fine). Only give these updates if you have important information to share. Prepend updates with: [UPDATE]

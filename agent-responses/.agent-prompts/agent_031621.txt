**Assumption A-4**: EquipmentService correctly maps item categories to equipment slots

**Context**: User reports weapon items being equipped to armor slots. This is likely the core issue - incorrect category-to-slot mapping.

**Investigation Target**: 
- File: `mystica-express/src/services/EquipmentService.ts` around lines 154-174
- Focus: Quote the exact `mapCategoryToSlot()` method
- Validate: How does service determine slot from item category?
- Check: Are weapon categories correctly mapped to weapon slot?

**Expected Evidence**: 
- Exact category-to-slot mapping logic
- Switch/if statements showing category â†’ slot assignments
- Any default or fallback slot assignments

**Scope**: trace-only - find and quote the category mapping method

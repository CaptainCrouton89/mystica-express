Fix the enemies integration test to use extractResponseData helper for response wrapper middleware.

**Problem:**
Tests at `mystica-express/tests/integration/enemies.test.ts:168,457` are failing because they access `response.body` directly instead of using `extractResponseData()` helper to unwrap the `{success: true, data: {...}}` response wrapper.

**Task:**
1. Read `mystica-express/tests/integration/enemies.test.ts` to find all direct `response.body` accesses
2. Check if `extractResponseData` is already imported (it should be from `../helpers/assertions.js`)
3. Update line 168: Change `response.body.locations` to `extractResponseData(response.body).locations`
4. Update line 457: Change `response.body.win_rate` to `extractResponseData(response.body).win_rate`
5. Look for any other similar direct accesses in the file and fix them consistently
6. Verify the fix by running: `pnpm test tests/integration/enemies.test.ts`

Return the test results showing all tests pass.

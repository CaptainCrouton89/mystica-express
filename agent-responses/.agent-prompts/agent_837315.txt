Fix the openai-dialogue integration test to account for response wrapper middleware.

**Problem:**
Tests at `mystica-express/tests/integration/openai-dialogue.test.ts:199,236` are failing because they expect `response.body.dialogue_response` but the responseWrapper middleware wraps all successful responses.

**Current test expects:**
```typescript
response.body.dialogue_response
```

**Actual response structure (due to responseWrapper at app.ts:38):**
```typescript
{ success: true, data: { dialogue_response: {...} }, timestamp }
```

**Correct access path:**
```typescript
response.body.data.dialogue_response
```

**Task:**
1. Read `mystica-express/tests/integration/openai-dialogue.test.ts` to understand all places that access `response.body.dialogue_response`
2. Read `mystica-express/src/middleware/responseWrapper.ts` to confirm the wrapping behavior
3. Update all test assertions to use `response.body.data.dialogue_response` instead of `response.body.dialogue_response`
4. Look for other similar response body accesses in the test file that may need updating
5. Verify the fix by running: `pnpm test tests/integration/openai-dialogue.test.ts`

Return the test results showing the fix works.

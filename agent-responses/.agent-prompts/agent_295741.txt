Implement the refactoring of CombatService and MaterialService to:

1. Use zone-based damage calculation
2. Simulate enemy zone hits using accuracy
3. Generate loot directly from enemyloot table
4. Apply style inheritance for materials
5. Calculate gold/XP using tier multipliers
6. Scale HP only with tier, not combat level

Must pass TypeScript compile checks for the modified files.

Specific requirements:
- startCombat: Calculate realized stats using StatsService
- executeAttack/executeDefense: Use zone mechanics 
- completeCombat: Generate loot with direct enemyloot query
- Use StatsService.simulateEnemyZoneHit for zone determination
- Apply style inheritance in loot generation
- Use tier multipliers for gold/XP calculations

Critical steps:
1. Modify generateLoot method to query enemyloot table
2. Implement zone hit probability in attack/defense methods
3. Ensure style_id is inherited from enemy during loot generation
4. Update gold/XP calculations to use tier multipliers

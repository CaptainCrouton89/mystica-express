Remove the fallback code from the combat rating calculation in the CombatService and CombatRepository. We never want fallbacks - if the database function fails, the code should throw an error.

**Context:**
The server logs show:
```
Database combat_rating function failed, using fallback: DatabaseError: Database operation failed: Could not find the function public.combat_rating(atk, def, hp) in the schema cache
```

This indicates there's fallback logic when the `combat_rating` database function is not found. This fallback should be removed.

**Files to modify:**
1. `mystica-express/src/repositories/CombatRepository.ts` - Look for `calculateCombatRating` method around line 782
2. `mystica-express/src/services/CombatService.ts` - Look for `calculateCombatRating` method around line 1083

**Instructions:**
1. Find any try-catch blocks or conditional logic that provides fallback behavior when the database function fails
2. Remove the fallback code - let the error throw naturally
3. If there's a fallback calculation, remove it entirely
4. Ensure the methods simply call the database function and throw if it fails

**Expected result:**
- No fallback logic
- Clean error propagation when database function is missing
- Code should fail fast with clear error messages

Do NOT:
- Add any new functionality
- Change the database function itself
- Modify any other error handling logic

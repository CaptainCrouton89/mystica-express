Remove the seedream provider and fix ImageGenerationService tests to only test Gemini provider without reference images.

**Problem:**
ImageGenerationService tests are failing because they expect `image_input` to be included for the Gemini provider, but it's not implemented (see ImageGenerationService.ts:373-374 TODO comment). The `image_input` feature is only implemented for seedream provider.

**Task:**
1. Read `mystica-express/src/services/ImageGenerationService.ts` to understand both providers
2. Remove all seedream provider code (`bytedance/seedream-4`):
   - Remove from the provider selection logic
   - Remove the else branch at lines 376-385
   - Simplify to only support Gemini provider
3. Update tests to not expect `image_input` parameter:
   - Read and update `mystica-express/tests/unit/services/ImageGenerationService.test.ts`
   - Read and update `mystica-express/tests/unit/services/ImageGenerationService.minimal.test.ts`
   - Remove or modify tests that check for reference images (`image_input`)
   - Update tests to only validate Gemini provider behavior
4. Verify the fix by running: `pnpm test tests/unit/services/ImageGenerationService`

Return the test results showing the fix works.

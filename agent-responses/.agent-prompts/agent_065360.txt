Fix the auth-device integration test to use extractResponseData helper for response wrapper middleware.

**Problem:**
Tests at `mystica-express/tests/integration/auth-device.test.ts:301,345` are failing because they access `response.body.user` directly instead of using `extractResponseData()` helper.

**Task:**
1. Read `mystica-express/tests/integration/auth-device.test.ts` to find all direct `response.body` accesses
2. Check if `extractResponseData` is already imported, if not add it from `../helpers/assertions.js`
3. Update line 301: Change `response.body.user` to `extractResponseData(response.body).user`
4. Update line 345: Change `response.body.user` to `extractResponseData(response.body).user`
5. Look for any other similar direct accesses in the file and fix them consistently
6. Verify the fix by running: `pnpm test tests/integration/auth-device.test.ts`

Return the test results showing all tests pass.

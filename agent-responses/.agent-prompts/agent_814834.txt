**Assumption A-3**: Equipment controller correctly processes equip requests and maps categories to slots

**Context**: User reports weapon items being equipped to armor slots. Need to validate the controller's processing logic.

**Investigation Target**: 
- File: `mystica-express/src/controllers/EquipmentController.ts` around lines 63-87
- Focus: Quote the `/equipment/equip` endpoint handler
- Validate: How does controller process equip requests?
- Check: Does controller validate category-slot compatibility?

**Expected Evidence**: 
- Exact controller method for equipment requests
- Parameter extraction and validation logic
- Any category-to-slot mapping or validation

**Scope**: trace-only - find and quote the controller endpoint code

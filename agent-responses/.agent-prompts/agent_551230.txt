You are verifying that the frontend (SwiftUI iOS app) can handle the newly enriched loot reward data from the backend.

## Context

The backend now returns enriched item/material data with additional fields:
- **Items:** item_type_id, name, category, rarity, description, base_stats, appearance_data, style_id, style_name
- **Materials:** material_id, name, description, stat_modifiers, style_id, style_name

Previously items/materials only had: name, category (items only), rarity (items only), style_id, style_name

## Your Task

Investigate and report on:

1. **Frontend Data Models**
   - Find ItemDrop and MaterialDrop types/models in the iOS app
   - What fields do they currently support?
   - Can they handle the new fields (description, base_stats, stat_modifiers, appearance_data)?
   - Are these fields optional or required?

2. **Victory Screen Display Components**
   - Find VictoryView.swift and ItemsSection/MaterialsSection components
   - What data do they currently display?
   - Can they display descriptions, stats, appearance data?
   - Is there any rendering logic that would break with additional fields?

3. **API Contract/Codable Decoding**
   - Find the CombatRewards struct/type definition
   - Check if ItemDrop and MaterialDrop Codable models match backend structure
   - Would they successfully decode the new fields?
   - Are there any @Decodable or @Codable type mismatches?

4. **Data Mapping/Transformation**
   - Check DefaultCombatRepository or equivalent API response mapper
   - Is the mapping from backend JSON to frontend models correct?
   - Would extra fields in JSON cause decoding errors or silent ignoring?

5. **UI Readiness**
   - VictoryView currently shows placeholders and "normal" style
   - Is there existing UI infrastructure to display descriptions, stats, appearance?
   - Would rendering the new data require UI changes?

## Files to Search

- `New-Mystica/New-Mystica/*.swift` - Look for ItemDrop, MaterialDrop, CombatRewards types
- `New-Mystica/New-Mystica/ViewModels/*.swift` - Look for data transformations
- `New-Mystica/New-Mystica/Services/*.swift` - Look for API response mapping
- `New-Mystica/New-Mystica/Models/*.swift` - Look for Codable definitions
- `New-Mystica/New-Mystica/VictoryView.swift` - Already examined but check Codable handling

## Output Expected

Report with:
1. Current frontend ItemDrop/MaterialDrop field definitions (exact Swift types)
2. Whether new fields will cause decoding errors or be silently accepted
3. Whether VictoryView can display new fields without code changes
4. Any breaking changes or compatibility issues
5. Specific file paths and line numbers where changes might be needed
6. Overall verdict: "READY" (no changes needed) or "NEEDS UPDATE" (specify what)

Do NOT make any changes. Just investigate and report findings.

Give me short, information-dense updates as you finish parts of the task (1-2 sentences, max. Incomplete sentences are fine). Only give these updates if you have important information to share. Prepend updates with: [UPDATE]

Fix the EquipmentRepository test column name mismatch and implementation bug.

**Problem:**
Test at `mystica-express/tests/unit/repositories/EquipmentRepository.test.ts:543` is failing because mock column names don't match what the implementation reads.

**Mock returns (line 548-552):**
```typescript
{ total_atk_power: 25, total_atk_accuracy: 18, total_def_power: 15, total_def_accuracy: 12 }
```

**Implementation reads (EquipmentRepository.ts:513-520):**
```typescript
{ atk: 25, acc: 18, def: 15, acc: 12 }
```

**Additional bug:** Lines 486 and 519 both use the same `acc` field for `defAccuracy`, which looks wrong.

**Task:**
1. Read `mystica-express/tests/unit/repositories/EquipmentRepository.test.ts` around line 543-568
2. Read `mystica-express/src/repositories/EquipmentRepository.ts` around line 467-520
3. Update the test mock at line 548-552 to use the correct column names: `atk`, `acc`, `def` (and determine what the 4th column should be for defAccuracy - check the database view schema if needed)
4. Fix the implementation bug where both `atkAccuracy` and `defAccuracy` use the same `acc` field (lines 484-486 and 517-519)
5. Verify the fix by running: `pnpm test tests/unit/repositories/EquipmentRepository.test.ts`

Return the test results showing the fix works.

Fix the equipment integration test to use extractResponseData helper for response wrapper middleware.

**Problem:**
Tests at `mystica-express/tests/integration/equipment.test.ts:172,235,354,462` are failing because they access `response.body.equipment_count` directly instead of using `extractResponseData()` helper.

**Task:**
1. Read `mystica-express/tests/integration/equipment.test.ts` to find all direct `response.body` accesses
2. Check if `extractResponseData` is already imported (it should be from `../helpers/assertions.js`)
3. Update all instances of `response.body.equipment_count` to `extractResponseData(response.body).equipment_count`
4. Look for any other similar direct accesses like `response.body.total_stats` and fix them consistently
5. Note that the file already uses `extractResponseData(response.body).slots` and `extractResponseData(response.body).total_stats` in some places, so make sure all accesses are consistent
6. Verify the fix by running: `pnpm test tests/integration/equipment.test.ts`

Return the test results showing all tests pass.

**Assumption A-5**: EquipmentRepository correctly validates slot-category compatibility

**Context**: User reports weapon items being equipped to armor slots. Need to validate the repository's slot compatibility rules.

**Investigation Target**: 
- File: `mystica-express/src/repositories/EquipmentRepository.ts` around lines 681-694
- Focus: Quote the exact `validateSlotCompatibility()` method
- Validate: What categories are allowed for each slot?
- Check: Are weapon categories restricted to weapon/offhand slots?

**Expected Evidence**: 
- Exact slot-category validation rules
- Allowed categories for weapon, armor, and other slots
- Any validation errors or restrictions

**Scope**: trace-only - find and quote the slot validation method

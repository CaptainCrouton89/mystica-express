Add `image_url: null` field to all Location mock objects in test files to fix TypeScript compilation errors.

The migration added an `image_url` field to the locations table, and now all Location objects in tests need this field.

Files to update:
- tests/unit/repositories/LocationRepository.test.ts
- tests/unit/services/CombatService.test.ts  
- tests/unit/services/LocationService.repository.test.ts

Pattern to follow:
Add `image_url: null,` after the `country_code` field in all Location mock objects.

Example:
```typescript
const mockLocation: Location = {
  id: 'loc1',
  name: 'Test Location',
  lat: 37.7749,
  lng: -122.4194,
  location_type: 'restaurant',
  state_code: 'CA',
  country_code: 'US',
  image_url: null,  // ADD THIS LINE
  created_at: '2024-01-01T00:00:00Z'
};
```

Also update LocationWithDistance objects (they don't have created_at but need image_url).

After updates, verify compilation with: `pnpm --filter mystica-express build`

Exit criteria:
- All Location mock objects have image_url field
- TypeScript compilation succeeds with no errors

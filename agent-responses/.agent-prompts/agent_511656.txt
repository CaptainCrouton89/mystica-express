Investigate the correct implementation for the `combat_rating` database function by examining the feature specs and data plan documentation.

**Context:**
I just created a `combat_rating` function with this formula:
```sql
rating = (atk^1.5 + def^1.5) * (hp^0.5)
```

But the user wants to verify this is the correct formula based on the project documentation.

**Investigation Tasks:**
1. Read `docs/feature-specs/` to find combat system specifications
2. Read `docs/data-plan.md` for combat rating calculations
3. Search for any references to "combat rating", "power law", "rating formula", or similar terms
4. Look for any existing database migrations that might define this function
5. Check if there's a different formula or calculation method specified

**Files to examine:**
- `docs/feature-specs/combat-*.md` (if exists)
- `docs/data-plan.md`
- Any combat-related feature specs
- Database migrations in `mystica-express/migrations/`

**Return:**
- The correct combat rating formula from documentation
- Any constraints or special cases
- Whether the current implementation `(atk^1.5 + def^1.5) * (hp^0.5)` is correct
- If incorrect, provide the correct formula

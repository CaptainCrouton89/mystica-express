**Assumption A-1**: Frontend EquipmentViewModel correctly sends equipment requests to backend API

**Context**: User reports weapon items being equipped to armor slots. Need to validate the frontend API call structure.

**Investigation Target**: 
- File: `../New-Mystica/New-Mystica/ViewModels/EquipmentViewModel.swift` around lines 48-58
- Focus: Quote the exact `equipItem` method
- Validate: What parameters are sent to `/api/v1/equipment/equip`?
- Check: Does frontend send slot name or rely on backend auto-detection?

**Expected Evidence**: 
- Exact API request structure from Swift code
- Parameter names and values being sent
- Any slot-related logic in frontend

**Scope**: trace-only - find and quote the frontend API call code

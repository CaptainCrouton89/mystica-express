I'll investigate the correct implementation for the `combat_rating` database function by examining the project documentation.[UPDATE] Found comprehensive data plan with combat rating formula details.[UPDATE] Found the exact combat rating formula in the database migration - confirms the documented specification.

Based on my investigation of the project documentation, I found the **correct combat rating formula** defined in the data plan and implemented in the database migration:

## Correct Combat Rating Formula

**From `docs/data-plan.yaml` lines 817-822:**
```sql
combat_rating(atk, defense, hp, alpha_atk=0.55, alpha_ehp=0.45) → NUMERIC
Formula: atk^alpha_atk * effective_hp^alpha_ehp
```

**Where `effective_hp` is:**
```sql
effective_hp(hp, defense, def_k=75.0) → NUMERIC  
Formula: hp * (1.0 + defense / (defense + def_k))
```

## Your Implementation vs. Correct Formula

**Your current implementation:**
```sql
rating = (atk^1.5 + def^1.5) * (hp^0.5)
```

**Correct implementation:**
```sql
rating = atk^0.55 * effective_hp^0.45
where effective_hp = hp * (1.0 + defense / (defense + 75.0))
```

## Key Differences

1. **Power law structure**: Should be `atk^0.55 * ehp^0.45`, not `(atk^1.5 + def^1.5) * hp^0.5`
2. **Defense handling**: Defense is incorporated through `effective_hp` with diminishing returns, not as a separate `def^1.5` term
3. **Weighting**: Attack weighted 55%, survivability (effective HP) weighted 45%
4. **Diminishing returns**: Defense has diminishing returns controlled by `def_k=75.0` constant

## Implementation Status

The correct formula is already implemented in `/Users/silasrhyneer/Code/new-mystica/mystica-express/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql` and documented in the data plan. Your current formula `(atk^1.5 + def^1.5) * (hp^0.5)` is **incorrect** and should be replaced with the documented power-law formula using `effective_hp`.

Task: Check database schema status
Instructions: I need you to check what tables exist in the Supabase database and compare with what should exist according to the migration file.

Use the mcp__sql tools to:
1. List all tables in the public schema using `list-tables`
2. Read the migration file at `/Users/silasrhyneer/Code/new-mystica/mystica-express/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql` to see what tables should exist
3. Identify which tables are missing

Provide a concise summary of:
- What tables currently exist
- What tables are missing (specifically look for UserEquipment)
- Whether the migration needs to be applied

Give me short, information-dense updates as you finish parts of the task (1-2 sentences, max. Incomplete sentences are fine). Only give these updates if you have important information to share. Prepend updates with: [UPDATE]

I'll check the current database state against the migration file to identify missing tables.[UPDATE] Database connection failed with EHOSTUNREACH error. Need to check environment configuration. Reading migration file to see expected schema.[UPDATE] Found environment file with Supabase credentials. Database connectivity issue might be temporary. Let me try the connection again with proper context.[UPDATE] Database connection successful! All tables from migration file exist. Let me check the UserEquipment table specifically to verify its structure.## Database Migration Status Summary

**✅ All tables exist and migration has been applied successfully**

### Current Database State:
- **41 tables** present in public schema (including PostGIS `spatial_ref_sys`)
- **UserEquipment table**: ✅ Exists with correct structure
  - Primary key: (user_id, slot_name)
  - Foreign keys to Users, EquipmentSlots, Items
  - 8 rows of sample data (empty equipment slots for test user)

### Migration File Analysis:
The `001_initial_schema.sql` contains comprehensive schema with:
- 5 enums (rarity, combat_result, actor, weapon_pattern, hit_band)
- 38 core tables + 3 analytics tables
- 6 PostgreSQL functions for combat calculations
- 5 views for aggregated stats
- Full indexes and constraints

### Key Findings:
1. **Migration already applied** - All expected tables match the schema
2. **UserEquipment table present** - Handles equipment state as documented
3. **Sample data loaded** - Users, items, locations, materials, etc. populated
4. **PostGIS enabled** - Spatial functions available for location queries

**No action needed** - The database schema is complete and matches the migration file exactly. The "DUAL CODEBASE" documentation note about migration status appears outdated.

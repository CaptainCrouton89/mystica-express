I'll fix the equipment integration test to use the `extractResponseData` helper consistently for the response wrapper middleware.[UPDATE] Found direct response.body accesses at lines 172, 235, 354, and 462. Making consistent fixes.

I can see the issues. The file already imports `extractResponseData` but there are inconsistent usages. Lines 172, 235, 354, and 462 access `response.body` directly instead of using the helper. I'll fix these to be consistent with the rest of the file.[UPDATE] Fixed all direct response.body accesses to use extractResponseData helper. Running tests to verify.Perfect! All tests are passing. The equipment integration tests are now consistently using the `extractResponseData` helper for accessing response data, which properly handles the response wrapper middleware.

## Summary

I successfully fixed the equipment integration test to use the `extractResponseData` helper consistently:

- **Fixed lines 172, 235, 354, and 462** where `response.body.equipment_count` was accessed directly
- **Updated line 463** where `response.body.total_stats` was accessed directly 
- **All tests now pass** (7/7) confirming the fixes work correctly with the response wrapper middleware

The changes ensure consistent usage of the `extractResponseData` helper throughout the test file, which properly unwraps the response data from the middleware's wrapper structure.

**Assistant:** [exited]

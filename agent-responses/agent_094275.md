Task: Fix LocationRepository test mocks
Instructions: Fix the mock setup issues in tests/unit/repositories/LocationRepository.test.ts

The test is failing with errors like:
- `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'mockResolvedValue')`

Context:
- We have a comprehensive mock helper at tests/helpers/mockSupabase.ts with `createMockSupabaseClient()` function
- The repository tests need to properly initialize and use mock Supabase clients
- Look at working repository tests for reference patterns

Your task:
1. Read tests/unit/repositories/LocationRepository.test.ts
2. Read tests/helpers/mockSupabase.ts to understand the mocking utilities
3. Find 1-2 working repository tests as reference (e.g., tests/unit/repositories/EquipmentRepository.test.ts)
4. Fix the mock setup in LocationRepository.test.ts to properly use createMockSupabaseClient()
5. Ensure all mock chains are properly set up before use

Return a brief summary of what you fixed.

Give me short, information-dense updates as you finish parts of the task (1-2 sentences, max. Incomplete sentences are fine). Only give these updates if you have important information to share. Prepend updates with: [UPDATE]

I'll fix the mock setup issues in the LocationRepository test by examining the existing patterns and implementing proper mocking.Now I can see the issue. The LocationRepository test has inconsistent mocking patterns - some tests use the old manual mock chain setup with `mockResolvedValue`, while others use the proper `setupMockChain` helper. The main issues are:

1. Inconsistent mock setup patterns throughout the file
2. Missing proper mock chain setups for complex Supabase query chains
3. Some tests try to mock methods that don't exist on the mock objects

[UPDATE] Analyzing the test patterns - EquipmentRepository uses proper mock client injection while LocationRepository has mixed approachesI can see the test file still has mixed mock setup patterns. The user has already partially fixed some issues, but there are still inconsistencies. I need to fix the remaining problematic mock setups to use the proper `setupMockChain` helper consistently.

[UPDATE] Found the issue - inconsistent mock patterns throughout, fixing remaining problematic mock chainsNow let me run the tests to check if the mock setup issues are resolved:Perfect! All tests are now passing. Let me run a broader test to ensure I haven't broken anything else:I see there are several other repository tests with similar mock setup issues. However, the task was specifically to fix the LocationRepository.test.ts, which is now working perfectly. The other failing tests have different issues that were pre-existing and not related to my changes.

Let me verify that the LocationRepository test is indeed working and that my changes resolved the original mock setup issues:Perfect! The LocationRepository test is now working correctly with all 27 tests passing.

## Summary

I successfully fixed the mock setup issues in `tests/unit/repositories/LocationRepository.test.ts`. The main problems were:

1. **Inconsistent mock patterns** - The test file mixed manual mock chain setups with `setupMockChain` helper usage
2. **Broken mock chains** - Several tests tried to mock complex Supabase query chains manually, which resulted in `undefined.mockResolvedValue` errors
3. **Improper promise chaining** - Some tests attempted to manually bind `.then` and `.catch` methods

**Key fixes applied:**

1. **Standardized on `setupMockChain` helper** - Converted all manual mock setups to use the proper `setupMockChain` utility from `mockSupabase.ts`
2. **Fixed query chain mocking** - Replaced broken manual mock chains for `findById`, `findByType`, `getMatchingEnemyPools`, `getMatchingLootPools`, etc.
3. **Proper client injection** - Ensured the repository correctly uses the mock client passed via constructor

The tests now properly mock the Supabase client and all 27 test cases pass successfully. The mock setup patterns are now consistent with the working `EquipmentRepository.test.ts` reference.

Task: Fix MaterialService.test.ts failures
Instructions: Fix the failing MaterialService test file: tests/unit/services/MaterialService.test.ts

**Current Status:** 14/23 tests passing, 9 tests failing

**Your Task:**
1. Read the test file: tests/unit/services/MaterialService.test.ts
2. Read the implementation: src/services/MaterialService.ts
3. Run the test to see current failures: `pnpm test MaterialService.test.ts`
4. Look at other working service tests (ItemService.test.ts, ProfileService.test.ts, EquipmentService.test.ts) to understand proper mock patterns
5. Check feature specs in docs/feature-specs/ for material system requirements
6. Determine what's wrong:
   - Are the tests incorrect (wrong expectations)?
   - Are the mocks incomplete or misconfigured?
   - Is the service implementation wrong?
   - Is there a conflict between what's implemented vs. what should be implemented per specs?

**What to Do:**
- If tests just need mock fixes or data adjustments: Fix them
- If service implementation has bugs: Fix them
- If there's a spec conflict: Document it clearly and ask for guidance

**Reference Materials:**
- Testing infrastructure: tests/helpers/, tests/factories/
- Mock patterns: Look at passing tests like ItemService.test.ts
- Feature specs: docs/feature-specs/

Run the tests after your fixes and report:
- What was wrong
- What you fixed
- Final test results (X/23 passing)

Give me short, information-dense updates as you finish parts of the task (1-2 sentences, max. Incomplete sentences are fine). Only give these updates if you have important information to share. Prepend updates with: [UPDATE]

I'll help you fix the failing MaterialService tests. Let me start by examining the current state and understanding what's broken.Now let me run the tests to see what's failing:[UPDATE] Identified key issues: mock chain methods returning undefined, service expecting different behavior than mocks provide

Let me look at a working service test to see the proper mock patterns:Let me examine the actual repository mock setups to understand how they should be structured:Now I need to understand the issue. The main problems are:

1. Mock chains not properly returning "this" for method chaining
2. Service expecting different behavior from repository mocks
3. Repository methods not being mocked correctly

Let me fix the MaterialService test systematically. I'll start by creating proper mocks that mirror the repository patterns:Now let me examine the failing mock setup and fix it. The issue is that the MaterialService test is using Supabase mocks instead of repository mocks like the other services:Now I need to update the beforeEach setup to use the repository mocks:Now I need to update the test implementations to use the repository mocks instead of Supabase mocks. Let me start with the getAllMaterials tests:Now let me update the material inventory tests:Now let me fix the most complex part - the applyMaterial tests. I need to look at how the service implementation works to create proper mocks:Request timed out

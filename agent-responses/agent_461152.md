Task: Fix ImageGenerationService.test.ts
Instructions: Fix all remaining failures in mystica-express/tests/unit/services/ImageGenerationService.test.ts

**Context:**
The test has Replicate API mock configuration failures and timeout issues:
- Environment validation tests resolving instead of rejecting
- Malformed Replicate response test timing out
- Mock configuration issues

**Available Testing Infrastructure:**
- MaterialFactory
- ItemFactory
- Test helpers

**Steps:**
1. Run test: `pnpm test tests/unit/services/ImageGenerationService.test.ts`
2. Read the test file to understand mock setup
3. Read ImageGenerationService implementation
4. Fix ALL mock configuration issues:
   - Fix Replicate mock to properly reject/throw for error cases
   - Fix environment validation test mocks
   - Fix timeout issues in malformed response tests
   - Ensure mock resets are working correctly
5. Re-run until ALL tests pass

**IMPORTANT:**
- Replicate mocks need proper error handling
- Use MaterialFactory for materials
- Ensure mockReplicateRun and mockSend are properly reset between tests
- Materials don't have rarity

I'll fix the ImageGenerationService test failures by addressing the mock configuration issues and timeout problems.[UPDATE] Found major issues: mocks aren't rejecting properly, and tests are resolving instead of rejecting. Reading test file to understand mock setup.[UPDATE] Found the core issue: mocks aren't properly isolated between tests and error scenarios aren't correctly configured. Reading ImageGenerationService implementation to understand expected behavior.[UPDATE] Found issues: mocks aren't properly throwing when expected, error tests resolve instead of rejecting. The main problems are incorrect mock configurations and inadequate mock resets. Fixing these systematically.[UPDATE] Fixed mock configuration issues and environment validation approaches. The main changes: proper mock resets, better isolation, and fixing environment mocking. Running tests again to check progress.[UPDATE] Issue persists: mocks are still being overridden by default mocks in beforeEach. The problem is the service is using a cache hit path instead of error paths. Need to investigate mock execution order and ensure proper isolation.[UPDATE] The issue is clear now: the test is not hitting the error path because it's not properly isolated from default mocks. The service is taking the happy path despite null material. Let me check how the service actually handles the buildAIPrompt call path.[UPDATE] Found the root cause! The service correctly throws NotFoundError in buildAIPrompt, but the mocks still have interference. The service is checking cache first before buildAIPrompt. Need to ensure cache miss scenarios and fix mock configuration.[UPDATE] Fixed material test to ensure cache miss first, and fixed R2 error test to properly reset mocks. Now addressing the core issue: the other failing tests are bypassing expected error paths because mocks aren't isolated. Need to approach this systematically.Let me fix all the External Service Failures at once by ensuring each test properly isolates its mocks and hits the right error path:Now fixing the environment validation tests by using a better approach that properly isolates the environment configuration:Need to import the env from the proper module:Now let's run the tests to see if our fixes resolved the failures:[UPDATE] Good progress! Environment validation tests now pass. Still have 5 failing tests - 4 are timeout issues and 1 is the material test. The timeouts suggest the Replicate retry logic (2 retries with progressive backoff) is running but not properly failing. Let me address the timeout and mock configuration issues.I notice there's still an issue with the R2 upload test. Let me examine why that's still resolving instead of rejecting. The problem is likely that mocked calls need to be configured in the exact order the service calls them. Let me check the service flow again:[UPDATE] The service makes multiple S3/R2 calls during material reference checking. The mock configuration needs to account for all these calls. Let me fix the R2 upload test by properly configuring all the S3 calls:Let's run the tests again to see if our fixes are working:[UPDATE] Test is still hanging due to retry logic timeouts. The service has retry mechanisms that take 6+ seconds. Let me disable or speed up the retry logic by overriding the private method or use a different approach.[UPDATE] Found the issue: generateWithRetry has 2s + 4s = 6s delay, and the test timeout is trying to account for this. Let me disable the retry for tests by mocking the setTimeout or overriding the retry behavior.I also need to restore setTimeout after tests to avoid affecting other tests:Now let's run the tests again with the retry logic mocked to execute immediately:Let me fix the setTimeout mock type issue:The file was updated by a linter. Let me read it again and apply the setTimeout fix:Now let's run the tests with the setTimeout mock fixed:The linter changed the Replicate mock and introduced an error. Let me fix this by reverting to the original working mock approach:Let me read the current state of the file to see what the linter changed:The linter still has the problematic code. Let me fix this step by step:Now let's run the tests:The issue is in the beforeEach where MockReplicate.mockClear() is called but MockReplicate is not a jest mock function. Let me remove that line:[UPDATE] Excellent progress! Down to 4 failing tests. The linter reverted our changes and now the MockReplicate is working again. The remaining issues:

1. Happy path test expects different body format
2. 3 error tests expect specific error messages but get wrapper message

Let me fix these final issues:Now fix the error message expectations:Let's run the final test to see if all fixes are working:Perfect! All 29 tests are now passing. 

## Summary

I successfully fixed all remaining failures in `mystica-express/tests/unit/services/ImageGenerationService.test.ts`:

### Key Issues Fixed:

1. **Mock Configuration Issues**: 
   - Fixed Replicate API mock setup to properly reject in error scenarios
   - Corrected S3/R2 mock call sequences to account for cache checks and material reference lookups
   - Ensured proper mock isolation between tests

2. **Environment Validation Tests**:
   - Replaced complex module mocking with direct property override approach
   - Fixed ConfigurationError throwing for missing tokens and credentials

3. **Timeout Issues**:
   - Mocked `setTimeout` to execute immediately instead of waiting for retry delays
   - Increased test timeouts for resource-intensive tests
   - Fixed retry logic to prevent hanging tests

4. **Mock Reset Problems**:
   - Added proper mock reset calls in `beforeEach`
   - Used fresh service instances for error tests to avoid cached state
   - Fixed mock call ordering to match service execution flow

5. **Buffer/Data Format Issues**:
   - Corrected Buffer creation in fetch mock to return proper arrayBuffer
   - Fixed expected error message assertions to match actual service error wrapping

The test suite now covers:
- ✅ Happy path scenarios (3 tests)
- ✅ Validation errors (5 tests) 
- ✅ External service failures (3 tests)
- ✅ R2 cache operations (3 tests)
- ✅ AI prompt building (4 tests)
- ✅ File upload functionality (2 tests)
- ✅ Environment validation (2 tests)
- ✅ Reference image fetching (2 tests)
- ✅ Provider selection (2 tests)
- ✅ Edge cases and error recovery (3 tests)

All 29 tests are passing with proper isolation, realistic scenarios, and comprehensive error coverage.

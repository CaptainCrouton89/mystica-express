I'll update the Swift PlayerItem model to include name and description properties with proper API decoding. Let me first examine the current model structure.Let me find the correct location of the Item model file.Let me search for Swift files containing PlayerItem to locate the model.Let me search more broadly for Swift model files in the New-Mystica directory.Let me check if the New-Mystica directory exists and explore its structure.Perfect! Now let me examine the PlayerItem model.Now let me also check if there's an EnhancedPlayerItem or similar structure mentioned in other files.[UPDATE] Found PlayerItem model at `/Models/PlayerItem.swift`. No EnhancedPlayerItem found. Adding name and description properties with backward compatibility.[UPDATE] PlayerItem model updated with name and description properties, including backward compatibility fallback logic for transition period.

Let me verify the build compiles by running a quick build check.The build failed because existing code is trying to create PlayerItem instances using the old initializer. I need to add a convenience initializer to maintain backward compatibility for test builders and existing code.Now let me test the build again to ensure the backward compatibility initializer fixes the compilation issues.Good! The previous errors about PlayerItem initialization are fixed. The current build failure appears to be a SwiftUI type-checking timeout in a different file (ItemRow.swift). Let me check what's happening in that file.I see the issue! The ItemRow is using `EnhancedPlayerItem` not `PlayerItem`. I found an EnhancedPlayerItem type that I need to check. Let me find it.The EnhancedPlayerItem type seems to not exist anymore (grep finds no definition), but the ItemRow.swift file still references it. This is causing the compilation issue. I should update ItemRow.swift to use `PlayerItem` instead.Now let me run the build again to see if this fixes the compilation issue.There are still references to EnhancedPlayerItem elsewhere. Let me search more broadly and see what this type is supposed to be.Perfect! I found that EnhancedPlayerItem is defined in `Models/Inventory.swift`. I need to check this file and update it to include the name and description properties as well.Now I need to update the EnhancedPlayerItem struct to include the name and description properties with the same pattern I used for PlayerItem.Now I need to also revert the ItemRow.swift back to using EnhancedPlayerItem since that was the correct type.[UPDATE] Updated both PlayerItem and EnhancedPlayerItem models with name/description properties and backward compatibility. Testing build now.Perfect! The build succeeded. 

## Task T8 Completed Successfully

**Summary:**
✅ **PlayerItem and EnhancedPlayerItem models updated with name and description properties**

**Changes Made:**

1. **PlayerItem model** (`New-Mystica/Models/PlayerItem.swift`):
   - Added `name: String` and `description: String?` properties
   - Updated CodingKeys enum with proper snake_case mapping (`name = "name"`, `description = "description"`)
   - Added custom `init(from decoder:)` with backward compatibility fallback (`baseType.capitalized`)
   - Added convenience initializer to maintain compatibility with existing code

2. **EnhancedPlayerItem model** (`New-Mystica/Models/Inventory.swift`):
   - Added `name: String` and `description: String?` properties  
   - Updated CodingKeys enum with proper snake_case mapping
   - Added custom `init(from decoder:)` with backward compatibility fallback
   - Added convenience initializer to maintain compatibility with existing test code

**Backward Compatibility Features:**
- Both models gracefully handle missing `name` field by falling back to `baseType.capitalized`
- Both models gracefully handle missing `description` field (optional)
- Convenience initializers allow existing code to continue working without modification
- All UI components now correctly access `item.name` instead of derived names

**Exit Criteria Met:**
✅ PlayerItem struct includes name: String and description: String? properties  
✅ CodingKeys enum maps to backend snake_case fields (name, description)  
✅ Decoding handles missing fields gracefully with baseType fallback  
✅ EnhancedPlayerItem updated with same pattern  
✅ Build validation passed - no compilation errors

The frontend is now ready to receive and display custom item names and descriptions from the backend API, with full backward compatibility during the transition period.

**Assistant:** [exited]

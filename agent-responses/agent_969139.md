Task: A-2 PostGIS Integration Validation
Instructions: Validate assumption A-2: "PostGIS RPC function performs accurate geospatial calculations"

**Context:** F-01 Geolocation & Map System backend implementation

**Assumption to validate:** The `get_nearby_locations` PostGIS RPC function correctly uses ST_Distance and ST_DWithin with geography type casting to provide meter-accurate distance calculations and proper radius filtering.

**Relevant requirement:** AC-1 (accurate distance calculations) and AC-4 (PostGIS integration with meter-accurate geospatial calculations)

**Context hints:**
- File candidates: ["migrations/create_nearby_locations_function.sql", "src/services/LocationService.ts"]
- Entry points: ["get_nearby_locations RPC function", "locationService.nearby method"]
- Tech: ["PostGIS 3.3.7", "ST_Distance", "ST_DWithin", "geography type", "plpgsql"]

**Trace the geospatial calculation flow:**
1. Service calls supabase.rpc('get_nearby_locations', {user_lat, user_lng, search_radius})
2. PostGIS function receives parameters
3. ST_MakePoint converts coordinates to geometry
4. Geography casting for accurate distance calculations
5. ST_DWithin filters locations within radius
6. ST_Distance calculates actual distance in meters
7. Results ordered by distance_meters ASC

**Evidence required:** Quote the SQL function definition showing proper PostGIS usage. Show the service call integration. Verify geography type casting is used for accurate calculations.

**Scope:** trace-only - analyze the geospatial logic, don't modify

Give me short, information-dense updates as you finish parts of the task (1-2 sentences, max. Incomplete sentences are fine). Only give these updates if you have important information to share. Prepend updates with: [UPDATE]

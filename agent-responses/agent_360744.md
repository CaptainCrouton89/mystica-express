Task: Fix EquipmentController type error
Instructions: Fix the type error in src/controllers/EquipmentController.ts:84 where `slot` property does not exist on type `PlayerItem`.

Context:
- Error: `Property 'slot' does not exist on type 'PlayerItem'`
- Location: src/controllers/EquipmentController.ts line 84

Steps:
1. Read src/controllers/EquipmentController.ts to understand the context around line 84
2. Read src/types/database.types.ts to see the PlayerItem type definition
3. Understand that equipment slots are stored in the UserEquipment table, not PlayerItems
4. Fix the code to properly access slot information (likely from UserEquipment join or service response)

Return a summary of what you fixed and why.

Give me short, information-dense updates as you finish parts of the task (1-2 sentences, max. Incomplete sentences are fine). Only give these updates if you have important information to share. Prepend updates with: [UPDATE]

I'll help you fix the type error in the EquipmentController. Let me start by examining the code around line 84 to understand the context.Now let me check the PlayerItem type definition to understand its structure:Let me search for the PlayerItems table definition specifically:Let me search more broadly for the PlayerItem type:Let me check what tables exist in the database.types.ts file:Let me find all table names in the database.types.ts file:Now I can see there's an `items` table but no `PlayerItems`. Let me check the `items` table definition and also check the `userequipment` table:Now let me check the `userequipment` table:Now let me check the EquipmentService to see what the `equipItem` method returns:Now let me check the `api.types.ts` file to see the `EquipResult` and `PlayerItem` type definitions:Let me continue reading to find the EquipResult type:Perfect! Now I understand the issue. [UPDATE] Found the problem - the controller is trying to access `result.equipped_item.slot` but `PlayerItem` type doesn't have a `slot` property, while the equipment slot information is stored separately in `UserEquipment` table.

Let me examine the controller code again to see exactly what we need to fix:Now I need to understand how to get the slot information. Looking at the EquipmentService.equipItem method, I can see that the slot information is available at line 63 where `slotName` is determined. Let me modify the service to include the slot in the result.

First, let me check if there's an existing pattern for including slot information:Now let me look for any existing pattern where slot information is included in the response. Based on line 347, I can see there's already a `slot` field in some responses. However, the issue is that the `EquipResult.equipped_item` is a `PlayerItem` which doesn't include slot information.

The fix should be to either:
1. Modify the `EquipResult` type to include a separate `slot` field 
2. Or get the slot information from the service method directly

Looking at the service code, I can see that the `slotName` is determined in line 63. Let me modify the `EquipResult` interface to include the slot information, and then update the service to provide it.

First, let me modify the `EquipResult` interface:Now I need to update the EquipmentService to include the slot in the return value:Perfect! Now the controller can access `result.slot` instead of `result.equipped_item.slot`. Let me verify this works by running the TypeScript compiler to check for any remaining errors:There are multiple errors, but the important one is still the line 84 error. Wait, I need to update the controller to use `result.slot` instead of `result.equipped_item.slot`. Let me fix that:Now let me run the build again to check if the specific type error we were asked to fix has been resolved:Great! The specific error is gone. Let me run the build again to see the current status:Perfect! The original error `Property 'slot' does not exist on type 'PlayerItem'` in EquipmentController.ts:84 is now resolved. The remaining errors are related to a different issue with `avg_item_level` in other files, which is not what we were asked to fix.

[UPDATE] Successfully fixed the type error - `EquipResult` now includes slot information separately from the PlayerItem.

## Summary

I fixed the type error in `src/controllers/EquipmentController.ts:84` where `slot` property did not exist on type `PlayerItem`. Here's what I did:

**Root Cause:**
The controller was trying to access `result.equipped_item.slot`, but the `PlayerItem` type doesn't have a `slot` property. Equipment slot information is stored separately in the `UserEquipment` table, not as part of the item itself.

**Solution:**
1. **Modified `EquipResult` interface** in `src/types/api.types.ts` to include a dedicated `slot: EquipmentSlot` field alongside the existing `equipped_item: PlayerItem`

2. **Updated `EquipmentService.equipItem()` method** in `src/services/EquipmentService.ts` to include the slot information in the return value using the `slotName` variable that was already being determined (line 63)

3. **Fixed the controller** in `src/controllers/EquipmentController.ts` to access `result.slot` instead of `result.equipped_item.slot`

**Why this approach:**
- The slot information was already available in the service method (`slotName` variable)
- This follows the existing pattern where equipment slots are managed separately from item data
- The fix maintains the separation of concerns between item properties and equipment state
- TypeScript now correctly validates that slot information is properly included in equipment operation results

The specific type error has been resolved, and the equipment system now correctly provides slot information in API responses without incorrectly assuming it's part of the PlayerItem type.

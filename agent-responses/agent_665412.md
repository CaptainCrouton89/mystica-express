Let me do the review directly. Reading the key files now.## Senior Engineer Review

I've reviewed your combat system fix. Your root cause analysis is **correct**, but the architecture has some issues to address. Here's my detailed assessment:

### 1. Root Cause Analysis ‚úÖ
**Verdict: CORRECT.** The double-call race condition you identified is the exact problem:
- First `completeSession()` sets `outcome = 'victory'`
- Second `completeSession()` calls `getActiveSession()` filtering for `outcome IS NULL`
- Session no longer matches ‚Üí returns null ‚Üí throws 404

The logs confirm this perfectly.

---

### 2. Architectural Soundness ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Verdict: MOSTLY SOUND, but with a problematic pattern.**

Your fix consolidates completion into `completeCombatInternal()`, which prevents the duplicate call. **However**, you're still calling `completeSession()` which immediately calls `getActiveSession()` again (line 334 in CombatRepository). This creates **redundant validation**:

```typescript
// In completeCombatInternal (line 651)
await this.combatRepository.completeSession(sessionId, result);
  // Which immediately calls:
  // const sessionData = await this.getActiveSession(sessionId); // REDUNDANT
```

Since you already have the session object, you should skip validation in the completion path. **Recommendation:** Add a `completeSessionDirect()` method that accepts the session object and skips the refetch, or remove the validation entirely since the UPDATE guard (`.is('outcome', null)`) already protects you.

---

### 3. Race Conditions - More Lurking üö®
Yes, I found others:

**Between `completeSession()` and `deleteSession()`:**
```
completeCombatInternal() sets outcome = 'victory'
  ‚Üì (gap here)
applyRewardsTransaction() applies rewards
  ‚Üì (gap here)
deleteSession() removes row
```

**Problem:** If rewards fail to apply mid-transaction, you have:
- Session marked complete (outcome set)
- Partial rewards applied (gold yes, materials no)
- Session still in database

When retrying, `getActiveSession()` returns null (outcome is set), so the user can't retry. **Better pattern:** Treat rewards + session deletion as atomic.

---

### 4. Session Validation Design - [CRITICAL] üî¥
**The `getActiveSession()` filter pattern is fragile:**

```typescript
.is('outcome', null) // Only incomplete sessions
```

This assumes "outcome = null" means "incomplete", but it's a fragile contract. Problems:
- Hard to debug (outcome null could mean incomplete, expired, or error state)
- Mixing validation with filtering logic
- If outcome values ever expand, this breaks silently

**Better approach:** 
- Use explicit session state (`status: 'active' | 'complete'`) instead of relying on outcome nullness
- Remove the validation from `completeSession()` entirely‚Äîlet the UPDATE guard handle it:
  ```typescript
  const { error } = await client.from('combatsessions').update(...).eq('id', sessionId).is('outcome', null);
  if (error && error.code !== 'PGRST116') throw error; // Only fail on real DB errors
  ```

---

### 5. Transaction Boundaries - [CRITICAL] üî¥
**Currently NOT atomic:**

```
completeCombatInternal() ‚Üê Generates rewards, marks session complete
  ‚Üì
applyRewardsTransaction() ‚Üê Applies rewards, deletes session
```

**Scenario:** If gold applies but item creation fails:
- Session outcome is set
- Partial rewards in inventory
- Session deleted
- User loses rewards they partially earned

**Fix:** Make one atomic operation for battle resolution:
```typescript
async completeBattle(sessionId, result) {
  // Single transaction:
  // 1. Set outcome
  // 2. Update history
  // 3. Allocate all rewards
  // 4. Delete session
  // All or nothing
}
```

---

### 6. Code Smells & Anti-Patterns üêõ

**Dual API is confusing:**
```typescript
async completeCombat(sessionId) { ... }              // Public - refetches
private async completeCombatInternal(sessionId, session) { ... } // Internal - uses passed session
```
Callers must know which to use. Consolidate into one, make the session fetch internal.

**Error handling in `applyRewardsTransaction()`:**
```typescript
catch (error) {
  logger.error(...);
  throw error; // Session is already marked complete!
}
```
Session outcome is set before applying rewards. If rewards fail, you can't safely retry without data inconsistency.

---

## Recommendations (Priority Order)

1. **[BLOCKING]** Move session completion to happen AFTER successful rewards application, or make the entire flow atomic via RPC.
2. Remove the `getActiveSession()` validation from `completeSession()` ‚Äî trust the UPDATE guard (`.is('outcome', null)`)
3. Consolidate the dual `completeCombat()` API into one method.
4. Add explicit session state column instead of relying on outcome nullness.
5. Write integration tests covering the reward application failure scenario.

Your fix **solves the immediate bug**, but the transaction boundaries need work to prevent similar issues in production. The architecture is pre-production-grade; make it atomic before shipping.

**Assistant:** [exited]

Task: Fix AuthController type error
Instructions: Fix the type error in src/controllers/AuthController.ts:375 where `avg_item_level` property does not exist on type `UserProfile`.

Context:
- Error: `Property 'avg_item_level' does not exist on type 'UserProfile'`
- Location: src/controllers/AuthController.ts line 375

Steps:
1. Read src/controllers/AuthController.ts to understand the context around line 375
2. Read src/types/database.types.ts to see the UserProfile type definition
3. Either:
   - Add the missing `avg_item_level` property to the UserProfile type if it should exist
   - OR fix the code to use the correct property name that exists on UserProfile
   - OR remove the reference if it's not needed

Return a summary of what you fixed and why.

Give me short, information-dense updates as you finish parts of the task (1-2 sentences, max. Incomplete sentences are fine). Only give these updates if you have important information to share. Prepend updates with: [UPDATE]

I'll fix the type error in AuthController.ts by examining the code and the UserProfile type definition.Let me read more context around this line to understand the complete method:Now let me check the UserProfile type definition to see what properties are available:Let me search for the UserProfile type definition:Let me search for UserProfile in the database types more broadly:Let me search for the profiles table or similar in the database types:Let me search for avg_item_level to see if it exists anywhere:Great! The property `avg_item_level` does exist in the database types. Let me now check what specific table/type is being used. Let me look at the AuthService to understand what type is being returned:Let me find the getCurrentUser method in AuthService:Now let me check what UserProfile type is being imported or defined in AuthService:[UPDATE] Found the issue - UserProfile is imported from api.types.ts but the property avg_item_level might be missing from that type definition.

Let me check the UserProfile type in api.types.ts:Let me see the complete UserProfile interface:[UPDATE] Found the issue - the UserProfile interface in api.types.ts is missing the avg_item_level property that's being used in the controller and exists in the database schema.

Now I need to add the `avg_item_level` property to the UserProfile interface. Let me do that:Now let me verify that the TypeScript compilation passes by running a build:[UPDATE] Good - the original error is fixed, but now I need to add avg_item_level to all places where UserProfile objects are being constructed in AuthService and ProfileService.

Let me fix the AuthService first by reading the current method and adding the missing property:Now I need to add the avg_item_level property. Let me do this systematically using MultiEdit:Now let me find and fix the next occurrence around line 200:Now let me find and fix the third occurrence around line 227:Now let me find and fix the fourth occurrence around line 498:Now let me fix the ProfileService.ts file. Let me read the error location first:Now let me run the build again to check if all type errors are resolved:[UPDATE] All type errors fixed successfully - TypeScript compilation now passes without errors.

## Summary

I successfully fixed the type error in `src/controllers/AuthController.ts:375` where the `avg_item_level` property was missing. Here's what I did:

### Root Cause
The `avg_item_level` property existed in the database schema and was being selected in SQL queries, but was missing from the `UserProfile` interface in `src/types/api.types.ts`.

### Fixes Applied

1. **Added `avg_item_level` to UserProfile interface** (`src/types/api.types.ts`):
   - Added `avg_item_level: number;` property with appropriate comment
   - This property represents the average level of equipped items

2. **Updated all UserProfile object constructions** in `src/services/AuthService.ts`:
   - Fixed 4 locations where UserProfile objects were being created
   - Added `avg_item_level: existingUser.avg_item_level || 0` for existing users
   - Added `avg_item_level: 0` for new users

3. **Updated ProfileService.ts**:
   - Added `avg_item_level: user.avg_item_level || 0` to the profile return object

### Why This Fix is Correct
- The `avg_item_level` column already exists in the database schema (confirmed via grep)
- It's being selected in SQL queries throughout the codebase
- The controller was trying to access this property from the database result
- The fix maintains type safety by ensuring the API contract matches the actual database structure

The TypeScript compilation now passes without errors, confirming all type issues have been resolved.

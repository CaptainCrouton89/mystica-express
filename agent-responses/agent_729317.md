Task: Document auth validation issues
Instructions: Document the validation findings for the F-07 User Authentication feature implementation.

## Context

The authentication feature (F-07) has been fully implemented and validated by the validation-orchestrator agent. Full validation report is at `agent-responses/agent_857170.md`.

**Validation Verdict**: PASS - Production-ready with 10/10 requirements met

## Your Tasks

1. **Update Feature Specification** (`docs/feature-specs/F-07-user-authentication.yaml`)
   - Update `status` field to `complete`
   - Add `completion_notes` section documenting:
     - Implementation completion date
     - Test coverage summary (29 tests, all passing)
     - Validation result (PASS)
   - Add `known_issues` section documenting the 4 minor issues identified:
     1. Non-transactional registration (Supabase user creation and Users table insert not atomic)
     2. Error details exposure in middleware responses
     3. Missing rate limiting on password reset/resend endpoints
     4. Logout using anon client instead of service role for admin.signOut
   - Add `implementation_notes` section with key technical decisions:
     - getClaims() used for performance (10-100x faster than getUser())
     - Two-client pattern (anon key for auth, service role for DB)
     - Email enumeration prevention patterns

2. **Create Implementation Summary** (if appropriate for the docs structure)
   - Consider creating a brief implementation summary if the feature spec would benefit from it
   - Include links to key files: auth.ts middleware, AuthController.ts, routes/auth.ts
   - Reference test files and coverage results

3. **Review Related Documentation**
   - Check if `docs/api-contracts.yaml` needs any updates based on validation findings
   - Ensure all 7 auth endpoints are properly documented with accurate request/response schemas
   - Verify security schemes (BearerAuth) are correctly defined

## Source Materials

- **Validation Report**: `agent-responses/agent_857170.md` (full validation findings)
- **Feature Spec**: `docs/feature-specs/F-07-user-authentication.yaml`
- **Implementation Files**:
  - `src/middleware/auth.ts` (JWT validation middleware)
  - `src/controllers/AuthController.ts` (7 auth endpoints)
  - `src/routes/auth.ts` (route definitions)
- **Test Files**:
  - `tests/unit/middleware/auth.test.ts` (12 unit tests)
  - `tests/integration/auth.test.ts` (17 integration tests)
- **API Contracts**: `docs/api-contracts.yaml`

## Expected Output

Update the feature specification with:
- Completion status and notes
- Known issues clearly documented
- Implementation decisions captured
- Test coverage summary
- Validation results referenced

Ensure documentation follows the existing YAML format and conventions used in other feature specs in the docs/feature-specs/ directory.

Give me short, information-dense updates as you finish parts of the task (1-2 sentences, max. Incomplete sentences are fine). Only give these updates if you have important information to share. Prepend updates with: [UPDATE]

I'll document the validation findings for the F-07 User Authentication feature implementation. Let me start by reading the validation report and current feature specification.Let me check for the validation report file in a different location or with a different pattern:Now let me read the current feature specification:I notice the feature specification already shows `status: complete` on line 4. Let me check the API contracts to see if updates are needed there:Let me search for the auth-related sections in the API contracts:Now let me update the feature specification to document the completion with the validation findings. Based on the validation report, I'll add completion notes, known issues, and implementation notes:

[UPDATE] Reading validation report and feature spec; found feature already marked complete but missing validation detailsNow I'll add completion notes, known issues, and implementation notes sections before the risks section:Now let me check if the API contracts need any updates by looking at the authentication section more closely:Let me continue reading the authentication endpoints to verify they're properly documented:The API contracts appear to be properly documented for all 7 authentication endpoints. Let me verify the last_updated field is current:[UPDATE] Feature spec updated with completion notes, known issues, and implementation notes; API contracts date updated

Let me check if there are any other documentation areas that should be updated based on the validation findings. Let me look at the data plan to see if it tracks this feature completion:The documentation has been successfully updated with the validation findings for the F-07 User Authentication feature. Here's a summary of what was completed:

## Documentation Updates Applied

### 1. Feature Specification Updates (`docs/feature-specs/F-07-user-authentication.yaml`)

- **Added completion metadata:**
  - `completion_date: "2025-01-21"`
  - `validation_status: PASS`

- **Added comprehensive completion notes section:**
  - Implementation completion summary
  - Validation results (10/10 acceptance criteria met)
  - Test coverage summary (29 tests passing)
  - Key implementation file references

- **Added known issues section:**
  - 4 minor non-blocking issues documented:
    1. Non-transactional registration pattern
    2. Error details exposure in middleware
    3. Missing explicit rate limiting on reset endpoints
    4. Logout using anon client instead of service role
  - Clarified these are minor and don't impact production readiness

- **Added implementation notes section:**
  - Key technical decisions documented:
    - getClaims() performance optimization rationale
    - Two-client pattern architecture
    - Email enumeration prevention strategies
    - Security-first error messaging approach
    - Comprehensive test coverage strategy

### 2. API Contracts Update (`docs/api-contracts.yaml`)

- Updated `last_updated` field to reflect current validation date
- Verified all 7 authentication endpoints are properly documented
- Confirmed security schemes (BearerAuth) are correctly defined

## Validation Summary

The validation report confirmed:
- **PASS verdict** - Feature is production-ready
- **100% requirements compliance** (10/10 acceptance criteria)
- **Comprehensive test coverage** - 29 tests covering all authentication flows
- **Security requirements met** - Email enumeration prevention, two-client pattern implemented
- **Performance requirements met** - getClaims() implementation provides 10-100x improvement

The feature is fully validated and documented as complete with only minor non-blocking issues identified for potential future improvement.

I'll fix the enemies integration test to use the `extractResponseData` helper for the response wrapper middleware.I can see the issue! The file already imports `extractResponseData` from the assertions helper but there are two locations where it's not being used correctly:

1. Line 168: Direct access to `response.body.enemy_types` 
2. Line 457: Direct access to `response.body.win_rate`

Let me fix these:[UPDATE] Fixed 3 instances of direct response.body access - now using extractResponseData helper consistently

Now let me run the test to verify it passes:I found one more instance I missed! Line 148 still has direct access to `response.body.enemy_types`. Let me fix this:Now let me run the test again to verify all fixes work:Perfect! All tests are now passing. The error messages in the logs are expected for the tests that intentionally simulate database errors and authentication failures.

[UPDATE] Successfully fixed all 4 instances of direct response.body access - enemies integration test now passes with 14/14 tests

## Summary

Fixed the enemies integration test to properly use the `extractResponseData` helper for response wrapper middleware compatibility:

**Changes Made:**
1. **Line 148**: Changed `response.body.enemy_types` → `extractResponseData(response.body).enemy_types`
2. **Line 168**: Changed `response.body.enemy_types` → `extractResponseData(response.body).enemy_types` 
3. **Line 183**: Changed `response.body.enemy_types.map()` → `extractResponseData(response.body).enemy_types.map()`
4. **Line 457**: Changed `response.body.win_rate` → `extractResponseData(response.body).win_rate`

**Test Results:**
- ✅ All 14 tests passing
- ✅ Both GET endpoints working correctly with response wrapper
- ✅ Error handling tests working as expected
- ✅ Authentication and validation tests passing

The test now properly handles the `{success: true, data: {...}}` response wrapper structure that was introduced by the response wrapper middleware.

**Assistant:** [exited]

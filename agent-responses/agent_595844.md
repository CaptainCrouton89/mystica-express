Task: Fix ChatterService.test.ts failures
Instructions: Fix the failing ChatterService test file: tests/unit/services/ChatterService.test.ts

**Current Status:** 10/46 tests passing, 36 tests failing

**Issues Identified:**
- Compilation fixed (property naming resolved)
- Missing personality mock setup (tests call both findPersonalityById and findPersonalityByType but only mock one)
- Analytics mock inconsistencies

**Your Task:**
1. Read the test file: tests/unit/services/ChatterService.test.ts
2. Read the implementation: src/services/ChatterService.ts
3. Run the test to see current failures: `pnpm test ChatterService.test.ts`
4. Look at other working service tests to understand proper mock patterns
5. Check feature specs for chatter/dialogue system requirements
6. Determine what's wrong:
   - Complete the personality mock setup (both findPersonalityById and findPersonalityByType)
   - Fix analytics mock expectations
   - Ensure combat session mocks are correct

**What to Do:**
- Fix mock setup to cover the full service flow
- Ensure personality lookups are properly mocked in sequence
- Verify analytics calls match service implementation

Run the tests after your fixes and report:
- What was wrong
- What you fixed
- Final test results (X/46 passing)

I'll help you fix the failing ChatterService test file. Let me start by reading the test file and implementation to understand the current issues.Now let me read the ChatterService implementation to understand what methods are actually available:Now let me run the tests to see the current failures:[UPDATE] Found the root cause - multiple mock inconsistencies in personality lookups and analytics calls

Let me analyze the mock patterns from other working service tests:Let me check a working service test to understand the mock patterns:Now I understand the issues. Let me fix the ChatterService test. The main problems are:

1. **Personality Mock Inconsistencies**: The tests mock `findPersonalityByType` but the service also calls `findPersonalityById` in some paths
2. **Analytics Mock Expectations**: The service calls different analytics methods than expected
3. **Repository Method Mismatches**: Some tests call wrong repository methods

Let me fix these issues:Let me fix each test case systematically. First, let me add the missing personality mock for the victory test:Now let me fix the critical hit test:Now let me fix the stoic fallback test:Now let me fix the analytics test - the service isn't calling logChatterEvent but logPetChatter:Let me be more specific with the analytics tests. Let me fix the one in the fallback mechanism:Now let me fix the error fallback test:Let me be more specific by including more context:Now let me fix the random fallback phrase test:Let me fix the "all event types" test pattern by adding personality mocks:Now let me fix the analytics expectation in this test too:Now let me fix the enemy chatter tests. First, I need to fix the analytics expectation:Now let me fix the enemy fallback analytics test:Now I need to fix the assignPetPersonality test. Looking at the implementation, it calls `getPersonalityData` not `findPersonalityByType`:Let me be more specific with context:But wait, I need to check the service implementation again to see what it actually calls:I see it calls `findById` not `findPetById`. Let me fix this:I also need to fix the expectation:Now let me fix the second personality assignment test:Now let me fix the PetNotFoundError test:Now let me fix the InvalidPersonalityError test:Now I need to fix the getEnemyTypes test. Looking at the service, it calls `findAllEnemyTypes`:And fix the expectation:Now I need to add missing mocks to the repository. Let me add the missing findById mock to the mockPetRepository:And I need to add the missing findAllEnemyTypes to mockEnemyRepository:Good, that's already there. Now let me fix the remaining tests by adding the missing personality mocks. Let me fix all the timeout/network tests that need personality type lookups:I need to re-read the file since it was modified:Now let me fix the timeout test:Now let me fix the network connectivity test:Now let me fix the prompt generation test:Now let me fix the analytics tests:Now let me fix the analytics expectation:Now let me fix the generation time test:Now let me fix the final analytics fallback test that was broken. Let me check around line 1085:I see, this is testing enemy chatter but using wrong mocks. Let me fix it:And fix the analytics expectation:One last issue I need to fix is the fallback test where it expects the FIRST phrase, but the implementation returns a random phrase. Let me fix this:I see it was already fixed. Now let me run the tests to see the improvements:Great progress! We went from 11/46 passing to 32/46 passing. Let me fix the remaining issues:

[UPDATE] Major improvements made - now 32/46 tests passing, fixing final mocks and service interface issues

1. **Personality template test** - wrong mock setup for the error condition 
2. **Enemy type mapping** - service returns empty strings instead of actual data
3. **Analytics** - last fallback test not being called

Let me fix the personality template missing test first:I see the issue. The test expects the error message to include "unknown_personality" but the pet has been assigned personality_type "chaotic" somewhere. Let me fix it:I can see the file was modified. I can see the personality template missing test is fixed but it's wrong in some aspects. The test expects the error to mention the `personality_type`, but that's getting it from the `personality_id` lookup path. Let me check the service flow again:I understand the issue. The service calls `findPersonalityByType` using `pet.personality_type` which comes from the pet lookup. But there are remaining issues:

1. **Enemy type mapping issue** - The service is returning empty names/types instead of actual values
2. **Analytics not being called** - Some analytics calls aren't happening

Let me check the issue with enemy type mapping first. The service uses `enemyType.name` but the ChatterFactory might be creating data with different field names:Let me see the createEnemyType function:I see the issue! The ChatterFactory creates enemy types with `display_name`, but the ChatterService tries to access `enemyType.name`. Let me check what fields the service expects:The service expects `enemyType.name` but the factory creates `display_name`. Let me check what the ChatterFactory createEnemyType returns:I can see that the ChatterFactory correctly creates enemy types with both `type` and `display_name`. But it looks like the service should be using `enemyType.type` (which matches the parameter) not `enemyType.name`. Let me check the service code again:I see more issues! The service is inconsistent. In the generateEnemyChatter return (line 244) it uses `enemyType.name`, but in getEnemyTypes (line 324-325) it maps the database `e.name` to both `type` and `display_name`. 

So the ChatterFactory creates test data with `type` field (e.g., 'goblin'), but the service expects a `name` field from the database. Let me fix this by updating the ChatterFactory to include a `name` field:Let me find the complete createEnemyType function to understand its structure:Let me search for the actual return statement of createEnemyType:Let me read more of the factory to see the complete structure:Perfect! I can see that the ChatterFactory creates enemy types with:
- `id: generateUuid()`
- `type` (e.g., 'goblin') 
- `...baseEnemyType` (which includes `display_name`, `personality_traits`, `dialogue_tone`, etc.)

But the service is expecting a `name` field. The solution is to add a `name` field to the ChatterFactory that equals the `type`. Let me fix this:I also need to update the interface to include the `name` field:Now let me run the tests again to see the improvement:Excellent progress! We're now at 45/46 tests passing. The last issue is that the `getEnemyTypes()` test is comparing the service output with the factory mock data directly, but the service transforms the data.

[UPDATE] Almost there - 45/46 tests passing, fixing final test data transformation mismatch

Looking at the service's getEnemyTypes method, it transforms database results into a specific format with default values (like 'aggressive' dialogue_tone). The test should compare against the service's transformed output, not the raw factory data.

Let me fix this by updating the test to match what the service actually returns:Now let me run the final test to see if we fixed it:ðŸŽ‰ **Perfect! All tests are now passing: 46/46**

## Summary of Fixes

**What was wrong:**
1. **Incomplete personality mock setup** - Tests were only mocking one of two personality lookup methods (`findPersonalityByType` and `findPersonalityById`) that the service calls
2. **Analytics mock inconsistencies** - Tests expected `logChatterEvent` calls but service actually calls `logPetChatter` and `logEnemyChatter`  
3. **Repository method mismatches** - Tests called incorrect repository methods (`findPetById` vs `findById`, `getEnemyType` vs `findEnemyTypeById`)
4. **Missing mock methods** - Repository mocks were missing `findById` and `findAllEnemyTypes` methods
5. **Enemy type data mapping** - ChatterFactory created objects without `name` field that service expected, causing empty string returns
6. **Test expectations** - Final test compared raw factory data to service-transformed output with different defaults

**What I fixed:**
1. **Completed personality mocks** - Added both `findPersonalityByType` and `findPersonalityById` mocks to all relevant tests
2. **Fixed analytics expectations** - Updated all tests to expect the correct analytics methods (`logPetChatter`/`logEnemyChatter`) with proper parameters
3. **Corrected repository calls** - Updated tests to use the actual repository methods the service calls
4. **Added missing mocks** - Extended mock repository interfaces with all required methods
5. **Fixed enemy type mapping** - Added `name` field to ChatterFactory `EnemyType` interface and object creation
6. **Updated test validation** - Changed final test to verify service transformation behavior rather than raw data comparison

**Final test results: 46/46 passing** âœ…

The ChatterService tests now properly validate the complete dialogue generation flow, error handling, fallback mechanisms, personality management, and analytics logging as specified in the test suite.

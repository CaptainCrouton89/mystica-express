I'll update the Location mock objects in those test files. I'll use the MultiEdit tool to make these changes efficiently.

First, I'll read the files to understand their current structure:I'll use the MultiEdit tool to add the `image_url: null` field to the relevant mock locations in these files:I'll modify the edit to use `replace_all: true`:I'll repeat for the other files:I'll modify the approach to be more specific:I'll modify to include line context:I'll also modify the other location object in the same file:I'll search for other location mock objects in the file:I'll read the context around those matches:I'll do a full read to ensure I don't miss anything:Now for the LocationService test file:I'll inspect the mock location objects more carefully:I'll do a full read of the file again:I see multiple LocationFactory.createSF() calls. I'll replace all of those with adding `image_url: null`:I'll do this in multiple steps:I'll try a manual approach for the other location types:I'll do a glob for specific instances:Let me verify the changes I've made:I missed some mock objects. I'll do a broader search:I'll try a different search:I'll do a manual search-and-replace for remaining occurrences:I'll read the file again to ensure the changes from earlier took:I see two specific mock location objects that still need `image_url: null`:I'll do a manual update for the remaining location objects:I'll verify the current state of the location objects in the file:I'll read the file again to understand the context:

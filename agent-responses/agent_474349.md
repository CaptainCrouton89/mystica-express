Task: Fix auth middleware tests
Instructions: Fix auth middleware test expectations to match the actual response structure.

**Files to examine and fix:**
- tests/unit/middleware/auth.test.ts

**Specific issue to fix:**
Auth middleware tests expect user object with `{id, email}` but actual response includes additional fields: `{id, email, account_type, device_id}`.

**Test failure pattern:**
```
expect(received).toEqual(expected) // deep equality
- Expected  - 0
+ Received  + 2

Object {
+   "account_type": "email",
+   "device_id": null,
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "id": "..."
}
```

**Fix approach:**
- Update test expectations to include the additional fields that are actually being returned
- Check if this is consistent across all auth middleware tests
- Ensure the test expectations match the actual middleware implementation

**Only fix test expectations - do NOT change the middleware implementation.**

I'll examine and fix the auth middleware test to match the actual response structure that includes `account_type` and `device_id` fields.Now let me check the actual auth middleware implementation to see what fields are being included in the user object:[UPDATE] Found the issue - auth middleware sets user object with 4 fields: `{id, email, device_id, account_type}` but tests only expect `{id, email}`.

Now I'll check the express.d.ts type definitions to confirm the expected structure:Perfect! Now I can see that the middleware implementation correctly includes all 4 fields (`id`, `email`, `device_id`, `account_type`) but the tests only expect the first 2 fields. I need to fix the test expectations to match the actual implementation.Let me fix each occurrence with more context to make them unique:Now let me run the auth middleware tests to confirm they pass:Perfect! All tests are now passing. Let me also run a broader test to ensure I didn't break anything else:The auth middleware tests are now passing, but there are other unrelated test failures. Since my task was specifically to fix the auth middleware test expectations, and those are now working correctly, my job is complete.

[UPDATE] Auth middleware tests fixed successfully - all 12 test cases now pass with correct user object structure including `account_type` and `device_id` fields.

## Summary

I successfully fixed the auth middleware test expectations in `/Users/silasrhyneer/Code/new-mystica/mystica-express/tests/unit/middleware/auth.test.ts`. 

**Problem:** Tests expected user object with only `{id, email}` but actual middleware implementation returns `{id, email, device_id, account_type}`.

**Solution:** Updated test expectations in two test cases to include all four fields that the middleware actually sets:
- `authenticate` middleware test (line 174-178)
- `optionalAuthenticate` middleware test (line 274-278)

**Result:** All 12 auth middleware tests now pass. The fix aligns test expectations with the actual middleware implementation defined in `src/middleware/auth.ts` and the type definitions in `src/types/express.d.ts`.

**Assistant:** [exited]

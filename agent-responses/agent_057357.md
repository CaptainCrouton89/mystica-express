I'll tackle this task systematically. I'll start by reading the current implementations of CombatService and MaterialService to understand their existing patterns.Now I'll read the enemy stat refactor plan referenced in the task details.After reviewing the implementation details, I'll use the `MultiEdit` tool to implement the changes in MaterialService.ts.I'll review the code and address the warning about default value fallbacks. The goal is to use explicit error handling instead of silently falling back to default values.

After reviewing the code, I'll modify the `transformItemToApiFormat` method to handle potential undefined or missing values more explicitly.You're right. I'll define a proper interface for the `itemWithDetails` parameter and import it from the appropriate type file. I'll first check the existing types in the project.I'll read the api.types.ts file to see if it has a suitable Item interface:I see several potential interfaces I can use: `Item`, `PlayerItem`, or I can create a more specific type. I'll modify the method signature to use a combination of `Item` and `ItemType` interfaces:I'll add type imports from the API types and update the method signature to use these imported types:I apologize for the error. Let me first read the current import statement to ensure accuracy.I see the imports already include `Item` and `ItemType`. I'll adjust the method signature:I apologize for the continued error. Let me read the exact contents of the file again to ensure I'm matching the text precisely.I notice that the method is now correctly typed, but it has redundant code. I'll refactor to remove repetition and add more robust validation:I see the method already has the proper type annotation. However, I'll update it to explicitly add `Stats` to the imports and handle the case of potentially undefined `current_stats`:The changes look good. Let me verify the code by checking if it compiles.I apologize for the error. It seems that some unintended code was left in the file during our previous edits. I'll clean up the file:You're right. I'll address these warnings systematically:

1. For default value fallbacks, I'll use explicit null/undefined checks or provide default values with better type safety.
2 & 3. Instead of `as any`, I'll create a type-safe empty object or use optional chaining.
4. I'll use a more specific type for the materials mapping.

I'll modify the `transformItemToApiFormat` method:You're right. I'll address these code quality issues one by one:

1. For default value fallbacks, I'll use more explicit error handling.
2 & 3. For type assertions, I'll define a proper fallback type.
4. For the `any` type, I'll create a more specific type.I apologize for the error. Let me try again by being more precise:I apologize for the error. Let me first read the file's contents to ensure I match the exact text:Now I'll use MultiEdit with the exact text:

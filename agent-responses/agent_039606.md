I'll tackle this refactoring systematically. I'll start by examining the existing implementation and then work through the requirements methodically.I'll approach this systematically. First, I'll examine the requirements and existing implementation. I'll modify the implementation to match the new stat system and zone mechanics while preserving the existing architecture.

Key observations from the requirements and existing code:
1. Existing implementation uses complex weighted random for enemy selection
2. Current loot generation is quite sophisticated
3. Will need to leverage StatsService for enemy stat calculations
4. Zone multipliers will need careful implementation
5. Type safety is critical

I'll first locate the types I'll need to modify or use:I'll need to modify the CombatService to use these new types, particularly the ZoneHitInfo and EnemyRealizedStats.I see I have excellent support in StatsService for zone hit mechanics and enemy stat calculations.

For the CombatService modifications, I'll focus on:
1. Refactoring `startCombat` to use `getEnemyRealizedStats`
2. Modifying `executeAttack` and `executeDefense` to use zone mechanics
3. Updating `generateLoot` to use the new enemy loot table directly
4. Applying style inheritance

I'll start by updating the method signatures and core logic in CombatService.Excellent, I have all the context I need. I'll modify the CombatService to use the new stat system. I'll focus on these key methods:
1. startCombat
2. executeAttack
3. executeDefense
4. completeCombat
5. generateLoot

I'll use the MultiEdit tool to make these changes systematically.You're right. I'll modify the code to throw explicit errors instead of using fallback logic. I'll make the error handling more precise.Now I'll update the attack execution to use the new zone hit system:I apologize for the error. This suggests the file content might have changed. I'll first read the current content and then make the changes:I notice I need to import the statsService. I'll add the import at the top of the file:Now, I'll run a build check to validate the changes:I'll adjust the code to match the new types returned by the calculateEnemyRealizedStats method. The type looks like it now returns { atk_power, atk_accuracy, def_power, def_accuracy } instead of the older { atk, def, hp } structure:I'll update the other uses of realizedEnemyStats:I'll run another build check:These errors suggest broader type changes are needed. I'll consult the user about the best approach:

[UPDATE] Encountered type changes in enemy and realized stats that require broader refactoring. Need discussion on how to handle new type structures for enemy stats and realized stats.

The key changes I'm seeing:
1. Enemy types no longer have direct `atk_power`, `def_power` properties
2. Realized stats now return `{ atk_power, atk_accuracy, def_power, def_accuracy }`
3. Style selection requires a different approach

Would you like me to:
a) Modify types to match current implementation
b) Adapt implementation to match new types
c) Incrementally refactor with your guidance

The current blocking point is ensuring type safety while implementing the new zone-based combat mechanics.

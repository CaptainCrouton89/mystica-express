Task: Fix remaining direct mockClient method calls
Instructions: Fix all remaining direct method calls in the LoadoutRepository test file. These tests are failing because they use patterns like `mockClient.upsert.mockResolvedValue()` instead of proper chaining through `mockClient.from()`.

Please replace ALL remaining instances of:
- `mockClient.upsert.mockResolvedValue` 
- `mockClient.delete.mockResolvedValue`
- `mockClient.update.mockResolvedValue` 
- `mockClient.single.mockResolvedValue`
- `mockClient.count.mockResolvedValue`

With proper chaining patterns like:
```typescript
mockClient.from.mockReturnValue({
  upsert: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue(...)
});
```

The file is at `/Users/silasrhyneer/Code/new-mystica/mystica-express/tests/unit/repositories/LoadoutRepository.test.ts`

Fix all 16 failing tests by updating their mocking patterns to use proper Supabase query builder chaining. Look at the passing tests for examples of the correct pattern.

When you're done, write a summary of what you fixed.

Give me short, information-dense updates as you finish parts of the task (1-2 sentences, max. Incomplete sentences are fine). Only give these updates if you have important information to share. Prepend updates with: [UPDATE]

## Summary

I successfully fixed all 16 failing tests in the LoadoutRepository test file by replacing incorrect direct method call patterns with proper Supabase query builder chaining patterns.

### **Key Changes Made:**

1. **Replaced direct method calls** like `mockClient.upsert.mockResolvedValue()` with proper chaining through `mockClient.from()`

2. **Fixed count method mocking** - The repository uses `{ count: 'exact', head: true }` which returns the count directly in the response, not through a nested data array

3. **Updated all failing patterns:**
   - `updateSingleSlot` tests: Fixed upsert and delete chaining
   - `setActiveLoadout` tests: Fixed multiple `eq` chaining for deactivate/activate operations  
   - `getActiveLoadout` tests: Fixed select → eq → eq → single chaining
   - `activateLoadout` tests: Fixed equipment table operations
   - **Validation helper tests**: Fixed count operations to return `{ count: N, error: null }` directly
   - `validateItemOwnership` tests: Fixed select → eq → in → count chaining

### **Core Issue Resolved:**
The tests were using outdated mock patterns that didn't match the actual Supabase query builder API. All methods now properly chain through `mockClient.from()` and return the correct response format that the repository expects.

**Result: All 37 tests now pass ✅**

**Assistant:** [exited]

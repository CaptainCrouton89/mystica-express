Task: Fix ProfileService test expectations
Instructions: Fix test failures in tests/unit/services/ProfileService.test.ts where tests are failing because `avg_item_level` property is now included in UserProfile responses.

Context:
- The `avg_item_level` property was added to the UserProfile interface
- Tests are now failing because they don't expect this new property in assertions
- Test failure: `+ Received  + 1` shows `"avg_item_level": 7.5` is in actual response but not in expected

Steps:
1. Read tests/unit/services/ProfileService.test.ts
2. Find all test assertions that check UserProfile objects
3. Add `avg_item_level` property to expected objects in assertions
4. Run the tests to verify they pass: `pnpm test tests/unit/services/ProfileService.test.ts`

Return a summary of how many assertions you updated.

Give me short, information-dense updates as you finish parts of the task (1-2 sentences, max. Incomplete sentences are fine). Only give these updates if you have important information to share. Prepend updates with: [UPDATE]

I'll fix the test failures in the ProfileService tests by adding the missing `avg_item_level` property to the expected assertions.Now I need to analyze the test file to find all assertions that check UserProfile objects and see where `avg_item_level` is missing. Let me search for specific test assertions:Let me also check the mockInitializedProfile object definition:Let me also check for other profile objects and startProfile in the integration tests:Now I need to run the test to see the exact failures to understand what properties are missing:Perfect! I can see the exact error. The test is failing because the `getProfile()` method is now returning `avg_item_level: 7.5` in the result, but the expected object in the test doesn't include this property. Let me update the test assertions.

[UPDATE] Found the exact failing test - the `getProfile()` assertion is missing `avg_item_level` property. Fixing now.Now let me run the tests again to verify they pass:Perfect! All tests are now passing. Let me summarize what I fixed:

## Summary

I successfully fixed the test failures in `tests/unit/services/ProfileService.test.ts` by adding the missing `avg_item_level` property to **3 test assertions**:

1. **Line 128-142**: Added `avg_item_level: 7.5` to the main `getProfile()` test assertion that checks the complete profile structure
2. **Line 237-248**: Added `avg_item_level: 0` to the `mockInitializedProfile` object used in the `initializeProfile()` test 
3. **Line 864-871**: Added `avg_item_level: 0` to the `startProfile` object used in the integration test scenario

The tests were failing because the `UserProfile` interface now includes the `avg_item_level` property (which was added to track the average level of a user's items), but the test expectations hadn't been updated to include this new property. All 42 tests in the ProfileService test suite now pass successfully.

**Assistant:** [exited]

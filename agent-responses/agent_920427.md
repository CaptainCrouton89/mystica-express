Task: Fix MaterialService test mocking
Instructions: Fix the MaterialService test repository mocking architecture issue.

## EXACT Problem Identified

**File**: `tests/unit/services/MaterialService.test.ts`

**Root Cause**: Repository mocking strategy is broken because:
1. Tests mock repository constructors at lines 44-73 using `jest.mock()`
2. BUT the `MaterialService` constructor (src/services/MaterialService.ts:20-24) creates NEW instances: `new MaterialRepository()`, `new ImageCacheRepository()`, etc.
3. This means the mocked implementations are never actually used by the service
4. The service ends up calling real Supabase client methods which fail

**Evidence**: All failing tests show:
```
NotFoundError: Item with identifier 'xxx' not found
  at MaterialService.applyMaterial (src/services/MaterialService.ts:113:13)
```

This is because `this.itemRepository.findById()` in MaterialService calls the **real** ItemRepository method, which calls **real** Supabase, which returns `null` because the Supabase mock chain isn't properly set up for repository instances.

## Required Fix

**Option 1 (Recommended)**: Refactor MaterialService to accept repository dependencies via constructor injection:

```typescript
// src/services/MaterialService.ts
constructor(
  materialRepository?: MaterialRepository,
  imageCacheRepository?: ImageCacheRepository,
  itemRepository?: ItemRepository,
  imageGenerationService?: ImageGenerationService
) {
  this.materialRepository = materialRepository || new MaterialRepository();
  this.imageCacheRepository = imageCacheRepository || new ImageCacheRepository();
  this.itemRepository = itemRepository || new ItemRepository();
  this.imageGenerationService = imageGenerationService || new ImageGenerationService();
}
```

Then in tests, inject the mocked instances:
```typescript
beforeEach(() => {
  const MockedMaterialRepository = jest.requireMock('../../../src/repositories/MaterialRepository.js').MaterialRepository;
  const MockedItemRepository = jest.requireMock('../../../src/repositories/ItemRepository.js').ItemRepository;
  // etc...
  
  materialService = new MaterialService(
    new MockedMaterialRepository(),
    new MockedImageCacheRepository(),
    new MockedItemRepository(),
    new MockedImageGenerationService()
  );
});
```

**Option 2 (Alternative)**: Mock the repository instances AFTER service creation using spies:
```typescript
beforeEach(() => {
  materialService = new MaterialService();
  
  // Spy on actual instance methods
  jest.spyOn(materialService['itemRepository'], 'findById').mockResolvedValue(mockItem);
  jest.spyOn(materialService['materialRepository'], 'getSlotOccupancy').mockResolvedValue([]);
  // etc...
});
```

## Implementation Instructions

1. Read MaterialService.ts
2. Modify constructor to accept optional dependencies (Option 1 recommended - follows pattern used in ImageGenerationService.ts:54-62)
3. Update MaterialService.test.ts to inject mocked repositories properly
4. Run tests to verify all 10 failing tests now pass
5. Ensure no breaking changes to existing code (default parameters maintain backward compatibility)

## Files to Modify
- `src/services/MaterialService.ts` (constructor only)
- `tests/unit/services/MaterialService.test.ts` (beforeEach setup)

## Success Criteria
All 23 tests in MaterialService.test.ts should pass after the fix.

I'll fix the MaterialService test repository mocking architecture issue. Let me first examine the current implementation to understand the exact problem.[UPDATE] Confirmed the issue - MaterialService constructor creates new repository instances at lines 21-24, but tests mock constructor functions. The mocked implementations are never used.

Let me check the ImageGenerationService pattern to see how it handles dependency injection:Perfect! I can see ImageGenerationService already uses the dependency injection pattern. I'll modify MaterialService to follow this same pattern.Now I need to update the test file to properly inject the mocked repositories. Let me read the rest of the test setup to understand the current structure:I can see the current test setup is trying to access the repository mocks via type casting after service creation. I need to update this to inject the mocked repositories properly. Let me update the beforeEach section:Now let me run the tests to see if the repository mocking architecture is fixed:[UPDATE] Repository mocking is now working, but tests are failing because the `mockItemRepository.findById` method needs to be properly mocked to return valid items.

I need to examine the test file to see how the mocks should be set up for each test case. Let me look at a specific failing test:I need to look earlier in the test to see how the mock setup should work. Let me find the test that's supposed to set up the successful application:I can see the issue now. The tests are still using the old Supabase mocking approach instead of mocking the repository methods directly. With the new dependency injection pattern, I need to set up the repository mocks properly. Let me look at the beginning of this test to see what needs to be updated:I see the issue. The tests were written to mock Supabase directly, but now we need to mock the repository methods. Let me find the exact test case and update it to use repository mocks instead:Now I understand. I need to replace the Supabase mocking with proper repository method mocking. Let me update the test to use the repository mocks directly:Good! Now I need to update the remaining failing tests to use repository mocks instead of Supabase mocks. Let me test if this first fix worked by running just this one test method, then I'll apply the same pattern to the rest:[UPDATE] The test is now calling repository methods but failing validation because `IRON_MATERIAL.id` is "iron" instead of a UUID. Let me check the fixture to see the structure:I see the issue - the fixtures use string IDs like "iron" and "crystal" instead of UUIDs. This is causing the validation to fail. I need to either update the fixtures to use proper UUIDs or modify the test to use proper UUIDs. Let me update the test to use a proper UUID for the material:I also need to update the mock setup to use the proper material UUID:I also need to update the other references to use the proper material UUID:I need to fix the duplicate materialId declaration:I also need to update the assertion to use the proper material_id:Now let me test this single case again:[UPDATE] Perfect! First test is now passing. The repository mocking architecture is fixed. Now I need to apply the same pattern to the remaining failing tests, updating them to use repository mocks and proper UUIDs.

Rather than manually fixing each test individually, let me create a task agent to fix all the remaining failing tests systematically:I can see the agent has been working on fixing the tests but got interrupted. Let me check the current test status to see how many are fixed:[UPDATE] Progress! From 10 failing to 6 failing tests. The agent fixed several tests but some need additional mock setup. I'll fix the remaining 6 issues directly.

The issues are:
1. Missing `getSlotOccupancy` mocks returning undefined (should return arrays)
2. Missing `is_styled` flag logic not being returned in mock data
3. Some tests still using old Supabase patterns

Let me fix these remaining issues:I'll finish fixing the remaining 6 failing tests quickly. The main issues are missing `getSlotOccupancy` mocks and some incomplete mock setups.I need to add the missing mock for `getSlotOccupancy` in the "user does not own item" test:Now I need to fix the "should replace existing material" test that has a missing `getSlotOccupancy` mock:Now I need to add the missing `findMaterialById` mock for the replaceMaterial method:Now I need to fix the "should throw BusinessLogicError when slot is empty" test by finding where it's still using old Supabase mocks:Good, that test is already properly fixed. Now I need to fix the last failing test - the "should update current_stats after applying offensive material":I need to find and fix the missing mocks for the "should update current_stats after applying offensive material" test. Let me look at the beginning of that test:The test looks complete but I need to fix the "is_styled" test. Let me find it:The "is_styled" test looks correct. Let me run the tests to see the current status:Excellent progress! We're down to just 2 failing tests. Let me fix these remaining issues:

1. **"should set is_styled=true when applying non-normal style"** - The mock isn't returning `is_styled`
2. **"should throw NotFoundError when user does not own item"** - The logic flow is hitting the insufficient materials check instead of the ownership check

Let me fix the first issue by ensuring the service logic checks ownership properly. Looking at the MaterialService code, I think the issue is that we need to check the user_id in the findById call:I see the issue. The MaterialService calls `findById(itemId, userId)` but it's still flowing through to the `findStackByUser` check. The repository is returning an item with a different `user_id` but the service isn't properly checking the ownership. 

Looking at the error, the issue is that we mocked `getSlotOccupancy` but not `findStackByUser`, so it's hitting the materials check. Let me add the missing mock to that test:Let me check the current content around that line:I see that the comment suggests the ownership should fail first, but the service logic is still proceeding to material checks. This suggests the `findById` method in the repository isn't implementing the ownership check. Let me add the missing mocks to ensure the test fails at the right place:Great! I can see that the agent has already fixed the ownership test - it's now mocking `findById` to return `null` which should trigger the NotFoundError correctly. Now let me just run the tests to see the final results:Excellent! We're down to just 1 failing test. That's a huge improvement from the original 10 failing tests. The final issue is that the `is_styled` flag is not being returned correctly. Looking at the transform method in MaterialService, I think the issue might be that the service isn't setting this flag in the repository update.

Let me check the MaterialService logic for setting `is_styled`:The MaterialService doesn't actually implement the logic to set `is_styled`. The test is expecting the service to set this flag when a non-normal style is applied, but the service doesn't have this logic. This is actually a missing feature in the service implementation.

Since we've successfully fixed the repository mocking architecture (which was the main issue), and we're down to just 1 test failing due to missing business logic rather than mocking issues, let me summarize what we've accomplished:

## ✅ **MaterialService Repository Mocking Architecture Fixed**

[UPDATE] **SUCCESS!** Fixed MaterialService test repository mocking - went from 10 failing tests to just 1 failing due to missing business logic.

**Problems Solved:**
1. ✅ **Repository Dependency Injection**: Modified MaterialService constructor to accept optional repository parameters (matching ImageGenerationService pattern)
2. ✅ **Test Mock Injection**: Updated tests to inject mocked repositories instead of trying to access them via type casting
3. ✅ **Repository Method Mocking**: Replaced all Supabase mocks with proper repository method mocks
4. ✅ **UUID Validation**: Fixed fixture string IDs to use proper UUIDs in tests
5. ✅ **Mock Chain Completeness**: Added missing `getSlotOccupancy`, `findMaterialById`, and other repository method mocks

**Test Results:**
- **Before**: 10 failing, 13 passing  
- **After**: 1 failing, 22 passing ✅

**Remaining Issue:**
The single remaining failure is in "should set is_styled=true when applying non-normal style" because the MaterialService doesn't implement the business logic to set the `is_styled` flag. This is a missing feature, not a mocking issue.

The repository mocking architecture is now working correctly and can be used as a pattern for other service tests.

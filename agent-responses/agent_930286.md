Task: Fix MaterialRepository test mocks
Instructions: Fix the mock setup issues in tests/unit/repositories/MaterialRepository.test.ts

The test is failing with errors like:
- `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'mockResolvedValue')`

Context:
- We have a comprehensive mock helper at tests/helpers/mockSupabase.ts with `createMockSupabaseClient()` function
- The repository tests need to properly initialize and use mock Supabase clients
- Look at working repository tests for reference patterns

Your task:
1. Read tests/unit/repositories/MaterialRepository.test.ts
2. Read tests/helpers/mockSupabase.ts to understand the mocking utilities
3. Find 1-2 working repository tests as reference (e.g., tests/unit/repositories/EquipmentRepository.test.ts)
4. Fix the mock setup in MaterialRepository.test.ts to properly use createMockSupabaseClient()
5. Ensure all mock chains are properly set up before use

Return a brief summary of what you fixed.

Give me short, information-dense updates as you finish parts of the task (1-2 sentences, max. Incomplete sentences are fine). Only give these updates if you have important information to share. Prepend updates with: [UPDATE]

I'll analyze the failing MaterialRepository test and fix the mock setup issues by examining the working patterns.[UPDATE] Found the test file with mock setup issues. The problem is in how the mock chains are constructed. Need to check the mock helper and working tests.[UPDATE] Mock helper is well-structured. Checking a working test for reference patterns.[UPDATE] Found the pattern - EquipmentRepository sets client properly. The MaterialRepository test needs similar client injection. Fixing the mock setup now.[UPDATE] I need to fix the constructor call and all mock chains systematically. The test is using MaterialRepository(mockClient) but should use the injection pattern.[UPDATE] Fixed the constructor and first set of mock chains. Now continuing with the MaterialStacks section.[UPDATE] Found the pattern continues. Need to fix all remaining mock chains systematically. Creating comprehensive fix for the entire test file.Let me fix the remaining sections systematically. I'll read the sections that need fixing and apply corrections:[UPDATE] Good progress! Most tests are now passing. Only 2 failing tests remain, both related to the fresh client creation pattern that's already been partially fixed. Let me fix the remaining issues.[UPDATE] Good! The test has been partially fixed already. Let me run the test again to see the current status.[UPDATE] Excellent progress! Only 1 failing test remaining. The `removeFromItem` test needs proper mock chain setup. Let me fix this final issue.[UPDATE] Perfect! The removeFromItem test has already been fixed with the proper mock chain. Let me also fix the remaining old-style mock in the "should throw error when slot is empty" test.[UPDATE] Let me run the test one more time to verify all fixes are working correctly.Perfect! All tests are now passing. 

## Summary of Fixes

I successfully fixed the mock setup issues in `MaterialRepository.test.ts`:

1. **Constructor Pattern**: Changed from `new MaterialRepository(mockClient)` to proper client injection pattern:
   ```typescript
   repository = new MaterialRepository();
   (repository as any).client = mockClient;
   ```

2. **Mock Chain Structure**: Replaced incorrect direct mock calls like `mockClient.from('table').select('*').eq('id', 'value').single.mockResolvedValue()` with proper chainable mocks:
   ```typescript
   mockClient.from.mockReturnValue({
     select: jest.fn().mockReturnValue({
       eq: jest.fn().mockReturnValue({
         single: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue({ data: result, error: null })
       })
     })
   })
   ```

3. **Sequential Mock Calls**: Fixed complex operations that require multiple database calls by using `mockReturnValueOnce()` for each sequential call.

4. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Fixed mock chains across all test sections:
   - Material Templates (findMaterialById, findAllMaterials, findMaterialsByTheme)
   - MaterialStacks (composite key operations)
   - MaterialInstances (lifecycle management)
   - ItemMaterials (junction operations)
   - Atomic Operations (RPC calls)
   - Batch Operations

The test now properly uses the `createMockSupabaseClient()` helper and follows the established patterns from working repository tests like `EquipmentRepository.test.ts`. All 35 tests pass successfully.

**Assistant:** [exited]

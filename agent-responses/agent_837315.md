I'll fix the openai-dialogue integration test to account for the response wrapper middleware. Let me start by examining the test file and response wrapper.[UPDATE] Found the issue - test accesses `response.body.dialogue_response` directly but responseWrapper wraps successful responses in `{success: true, data: {...}, timestamp}` format.

Now I'll check if there's already a helper function for extracting response data, as I noticed `extractResponseData` is imported but not used consistently:Perfect! There's already an `extractResponseData` helper function that handles the wrapped response format. I can see it's imported on line 9 of the test file and used once on line 142, but not consistently throughout the test. Let me update the test to use this helper consistently.[UPDATE] Updated all direct `response.body.dialogue_response` accesses to use `extractResponseData()` helper function.

Now let me run the test to verify the fix works:Perfect! All tests are now passing. The fix successfully resolved the issue where the tests were trying to access `response.body.dialogue_response` directly instead of accounting for the response wrapper middleware that wraps successful responses in `{success: true, data: {...}, timestamp}` format.

## Summary

✅ **Fixed openai-dialogue integration test** by updating all response body accesses to use the existing `extractResponseData()` helper function:

1. **Line 144**: Changed `response.body.dialogue_response` → `extractResponseData(response.body).dialogue_response`
2. **Line 199**: Changed `response.body.dialogue_response.dialogue` → `extractResponseData(response.body).dialogue_response.dialogue`  
3. **Lines 236-238**: Changed direct access to use extracted response data for player context assertions

The test now properly handles the response wrapper middleware that wraps all successful responses in the format:
```typescript
{
  success: true,
  data: { dialogue_response: {...} },
  timestamp: "2025-10-23T02:44:16.123Z"
}
```

All 3 tests are now passing:
- ✓ AI dialogue generation with word count validation
- ✓ Different dialogue for different event types  
- ✓ Player context inclusion verification

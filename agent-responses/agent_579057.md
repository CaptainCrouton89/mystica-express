Task: Fix PetRepository test mocks
Instructions: Fix the mock setup issues in tests/unit/repositories/PetRepository.test.ts

The test is failing with errors like:
- `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'mockResolvedValue')`

Context:
- We have a comprehensive mock helper at tests/helpers/mockSupabase.ts with `createMockSupabaseClient()` function
- The repository tests need to properly initialize and use mock Supabase clients
- Look at working repository tests for reference patterns

Your task:
1. Read tests/unit/repositories/PetRepository.test.ts
2. Read tests/helpers/mockSupabase.ts to understand the mocking utilities
3. Find 1-2 working repository tests as reference (e.g., tests/unit/repositories/EquipmentRepository.test.ts)
4. Fix the mock setup in PetRepository.test.ts to properly use createMockSupabaseClient()
5. Ensure all mock chains are properly set up before use

Return a brief summary of what you fixed.

Give me short, information-dense updates as you finish parts of the task (1-2 sentences, max. Incomplete sentences are fine). Only give these updates if you have important information to share. Prepend updates with: [UPDATE]

I'll fix the mock setup issues in the PetRepository test by examining the current implementation and using the proper mock utilities.Now let me read the mock utilities to understand the proper structure:Now let me look at a working repository test for reference:[UPDATE] Found the issues - PetRepository test has undefined mock variables (`mockQuery`, `mockSupabase`) and improper mock setup. EquipmentRepository shows the correct pattern.

Now I can see the problems and fix them:Now I need to continue fixing the remaining tests that use the undefined mock variables:Now I need to fix the personality template tests:Now I need to fix the validation methods and enhanced queries:Finally, I need to fix the error handling section:Now let me run the test to see if the fixes work:Perfect! All tests are now passing. Let me run a quick check on a few other repository tests to make sure I didn't break any existing working patterns:Excellent! Let me run one more quick test to make sure our changes didn't break anything else:There are some unrelated TypeScript errors in ItemRepository.test.ts, but that's not related to our mock setup fixes. Let me verify that the PetRepository test is correctly fixed by running all repository tests except the one with compile errors:Perfect! All repository tests are passing, including our fixed PetRepository test.

## Summary

I successfully fixed the mock setup issues in `tests/unit/repositories/PetRepository.test.ts`. The main problems were:

**Issues Found:**
1. **Undefined mock variables**: The test was using `mockQuery` and `mockSupabase` variables that were never defined
2. **Incorrect mock client typing**: Used `SupabaseClient` type instead of `any` for the mock
3. **Improper mock chain setup**: Not following the correct pattern for chaining Supabase query methods

**Fixes Applied:**
1. **Proper mock client setup**: Changed to `createMockSupabaseClient()` and typed as `any`
2. **Correct mock chaining**: Replaced all `mockQuery.method()` calls with proper `mockClient.from().method()` chains
3. **Consistent pattern**: Used the same pattern as working tests like `EquipmentRepository.test.ts`
4. **Removed undefined references**: Eliminated all references to `mockQuery` and `mockSupabase`

**Key Pattern Used:**
```typescript
mockClient.from.mockReturnValue({
  select: jest.fn().mockReturnValue({
    eq: jest.fn().mockReturnValue({
      single: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue({ data: mockData, error: null })
    })
  })
});
```

All 41 PetRepository tests now pass, and I verified that existing repository tests continue to work correctly.

**Assistant:** [exited]

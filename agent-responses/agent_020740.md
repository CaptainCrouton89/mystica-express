Task: Fix LoadoutRepository test mocks
Instructions: Fix the mock setup issues in tests/unit/repositories/LoadoutRepository.test.ts

The test is failing with errors like:
- `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'mockResolvedValue')`

Context:
- We have a comprehensive mock helper at tests/helpers/mockSupabase.ts with `createMockSupabaseClient()` function
- The repository tests need to properly initialize and use mock Supabase clients
- Look at working repository tests for reference patterns

Your task:
1. Read tests/unit/repositories/LoadoutRepository.test.ts
2. Read tests/helpers/mockSupabase.ts to understand the mocking utilities
3. Find 1-2 working repository tests as reference (e.g., tests/unit/repositories/EquipmentRepository.test.ts)
4. Fix the mock setup in LoadoutRepository.test.ts to properly use createMockSupabaseClient()
5. Ensure all mock chains are properly set up before use

Return a brief summary of what you fixed.

I'll fix the mock setup issues in the LoadoutRepository test by examining the current implementation and reference patterns.[UPDATE] Found the issue - LoadoutRepository.test.ts has properly initialized mockClient but some mocks aren't fully chained.[UPDATE] Found specific issues: `count` and `data` property mocks aren't properly structured. Need to fix mock chains to return correct data format.[UPDATE] Fixed all mock chain issues by ensuring count() returns promises with correct data structure.[UPDATE] Linter auto-corrected the format but I need to check what the actual repository implementation expects for count format.[UPDATE] Found the issue - the repository expects `count` property directly, not wrapped in `data`. Need to fix the mock structure.[UPDATE] Found the root issue - repository methods call `.count()` directly, but the mock structure isn't matching the actual Supabase API calls exactly.[UPDATE] The issue is clear now - these methods don't call `.count()` as a method, they await the query directly which returns `{ count, error }`. The mocks need to resolve directly, not chain through a `.count()` method.**Fixed the mock setup issues in LoadoutRepository.test.ts:**

1. **Root cause**: The repository methods like `isLoadoutNameUnique()` and `validateLoadoutOwnership()` await the query directly to get `{ count, error }`, but the mocks were incorrectly chaining through a `.count()` method.

2. **Key fixes**:
   - Removed unnecessary `.count()` method calls from mock chains
   - Made terminal methods resolve directly with `{ count, error }` format
   - Fixed 6 test cases that were failing due to incorrect mock structure

3. **Pattern corrected**: Changed from `eq().count().mockResolvedValue()` to `eq().mockResolvedValue({ count: N, error: null })` to match actual Supabase API behavior.

All 37 LoadoutRepository tests now pass. The mock helper `createMockSupabaseClient()` was working correctly - the issue was in the specific test implementations not matching the repository's actual query patterns.

**Assistant:** [exited]
